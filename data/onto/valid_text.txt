A Russian diver has found the bodies of three of the 118 sailors who were killed when the nuclear submarine Kursk sank in the Barents Sea .
The diver entered the sub after a Russian and Norwegian recovery team cut a hole wide enough for him to enter a rear compartment .
The drilling and cutting effort took several days .
Navy officials do not expect that all 118 bodies can be recovered .
The Balkan Stability Pact has admitted Yugoslavia as a full member marking Belgrade 's return to the international community after years of isolation under ousted President Slobodan Milosevic .
The head of the Stability Pact for South Eastern Europe Bodo Hombak announced the decision as representatives of member countries met in the Romanian capital Bucharest .
A special envoy of Yugoslavia 's new President Vojislav Kostunica reaffirmed his country 's commitment to peace in the region .
The Balkan Stability Pact was established last year in response to the Kosovo crisis .
Here in the United States , it 's just a week and a day before Americans go to the polls to fill offices from local school boards to Congress and the President .
In the latest daily CNN USA Today Gallup popular opinion survey , George W Bush , the Governor of Texas , the Republican nominee , holds a 49 % to 42 % advantage over his Democratic opponent Al Gore , the Vice President , but two other major surveys gave Mr. Bush only a one - point lead .
On Sunday , several major newspapers weighed in with their endorsements and VOA 's Peter Hymline has that story .
In its Sunday editions , the New York Times calls Vice President Gore , the man best equipped for the presidency by virtue of his knowledge of government , his experience at the top levels of federal and diplomatic decision making and his devotion to the general welfare .
The Times editorial says Mr. Gore has , in its words , struggled impressively and successfully to escape the shadow of the Clinton administration 's ethical lapses .
The paper 's editorial board goes on to say , we believe Mr. Gore would never follow Bill Clinton 's example of reckless conduct that cheapens the Presidency .
The Times also praise Republican candidate George W Bush for running what was described as a largely positive inclusive campaign but the writers said they had concluded Mr. Bush 's agenda was harsh on issues such as women 's rights , guns , and law enforcement .
The Times joins the Washington Post newspaper , which earlier gave its backing to Mr. Gore .
Other major dailies throwing their support to the Vice President Sunday included The Philadelphia Inquirer , The Denver Post and The San Jose California Mercury News .
Mr. Bush also picked up some key endorsements Sunday including both major Chicago papers .
In its editorial , The Chicago Tribune called Mr. Gore a decent man but concluded that , in its words , his penchant for enhancement has become something of a running joke .
The Tribune endorsement says this is an election about honesty , about restoring bipartisanship , about fostering government that will nurture a booming economy without getting in the way of American ingenuity .
The paper concludes that there is one candidate who will do that and that is George W Bush .
The battle of the editorials reflects what many political analysts predict will be one of the closest Presidential races in decades .
Most opinion polls give Mr. Bush a slight lead but a just released survey by Newsweek magazine puts the text .
The Newsweek poll indicates voters consider Vice President Gore the more intelligent candidate , but they see Governor Bush as more honest .

A Venezuelan Ford executive says Firestone hid information about tyre defects from Ford and should be held responsible for more than one hundred traffic accidents in the South American country .
Hector Rodriguez told the hearing of the Venezuelan Consumer Protection Agency that Bridgeton Firestone knew about the tyre defects for many months and should be held responsible for the accidents .
In a letter to the consumer panel a spokesman for Firestone said the company 's appearance at Wednesday 's hearing would have implied fault , which it denies .
The Venezuelan government panel wants both Ford and Firestone to compensate victims of accidents caused by Ford vehicles equipped with Firestone tyres .
Some 46 people have died on Venezuelan highways in accidents caused by the vehicles .

The United States has lifted some of the economic sanctions it imposed on Yugoslavia two years ago .
As VOA 's Eve Cornet reports from Belgrade , a US special envoy gave the news to President Vojislav Kostunica .
Balkans advisor James O'Brien and President Kostunica met for the first top - level talks between the United States and Yugoslavia , since the break of diplomatic relations on the eve of Nato air strikes in 1999 .
President Kostunica said he was ready for dialogue with the West , but stressed that territorial accords reached with international negotiators in the Balkans should be respected .
Balkans envoy O'Brian stressed that the US would begin lifting sanctions against Yugoslavia and that only technical issues remain an obstacle to reestablishing relations .
However , key sanctions which directly target ousted Yugoslav leader Slobodan Milosevic and his allies remain in place .
Meanwhile , parties in Slobodan Milosevic 's socialist coalition are making it clear they plan to hold onto control of the Serbian government , despite calls for new elections .
Eve Cornet , VOA News , Belgrade .
A leading expert on international finance , Johns Hopkins University economist , Steve Hanky says Yugoslavia 's new President Vojislav Kostunica only has a few weeks to reassure financial stability in the dominant republic of Serbia by stabilizing the inflation - prone Yugoslav dinar .
VOA 's Barry Wood spoke with Mr. Hanky , who recently returned from several weeks in Europe .
Mr. Hanky says that President Kostunica has only two options for achieving financial stability in Serbia .
He can either abandon the dinar and adopt the German mark as the Yugoslav Republic of Montenegro has done or , Mr. Hanky says , Serbia can adopt a currency board system under which a new currency would be issued under conditions of utmost financial discipline .
I think if Kostunica does not move in a direction decisively within the next month of abandoning the dinar completely or going to a deutsche mark based currency board where we have a foreign governor on the board , the chances for economic unification in the area and economic recovery in Serbia are slim at best .
Mr. Hanky says it 's essential that President Kostunica embrace the principle of sound money , something Mr. Hanky believes is as important as the rule of law .
Last week , the new acting head of the Yugoslav Central Bank devalued the dinar , bringing it to 30 to the dollar , compared to the previous official rate of 20 .
Mr. Hanky , who regards the dinar as the world 's worst currency , says the deutsch mark is becoming the de facto money in the entire Balkan region .
If they use the d mark in Serbia , obviously there would be essentially the same system that they have in Montenegro and if they had a currency board with a foreign national running the thing , like Bosnia , it would essentially mean that they had a unified system was what they have in Montenegro because with Montenegro , they would still have the d mark as legal tender , but they would also use this new currency board money from Serbia and there would be absolutely no problem , and furthermore , from a regional point of view , you 'd have essentially most of the Balkans in a unified currency zone because Bulgaria has a currency board that 's d mark based .
Bosnia has a currency board that 's d mark based .
Kosovo has a d mark , Montenegro has a d mark .
Mr. Hanky was instrumental in developing the deutsche mark based currency systems throughout the region .
Advisors to Mr. Kostunica say they are considering a currency board system for Serbia .

President Clinton called for all weapons in Northern Ireland to be put away forever .
Mr. Clinton said Wednesday the United States would intensify cooperation with Britain and Ireland to fight groups seeking to undermine the Good Friday power showing agreement .
He was addressing a large gathering of people in East Belfast .
This is the last chance I will have as President to speak to the people of Northern Ireland .
Let me say to all of you that I have tried to be pretty straightforward today in my remarks and not nearly as emotional as I feel .
Mr. Clinton spoke at the end of his third official trip to Northern Ireland after holding talks with the province 's leaders .
President Clinton has telephoned Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat in a bid to restart Israeli - Palestinian peace negotiations .
An Arafat advisor told reporters the two leaders agreed to work together to try to reach an agreement .
The United States is exploring the possibility of hosting new peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians in Washington as early as next week .
The United Nations says nationalist parties are the apparent winners in Saturday 's general elections in Bosnia - Herzegovina .
The outcome disappointed Western officials who had hoped the balloting would signal an end to the country 's ethnic divisions .

President Clinton will host a meeting at the White house Saturday with Israeli and Palestinian negotiators who are holding talks in Washington .
Israeli Foreign Minister Shlomo Ben - Ami and lead Palestinian negotiator Sayeeb Erekat are coming to report to the President and to meet with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright .
On Friday Ms. Albright joined the two negotiators at the peace talks at Bowling Airbase in Washington .
The talks are aimed at putting the peace process back on track after three months of violence .
Mark Rengav , a spokesman for the Israeli embassy in Washington told VOA , the security of the Israeli state is key to reaching a settlement with the Palestinians .
If Israel is going to offer a substantial compromise , passing over the overwhelming majority of the West Bank and Gaza to full Palestinian control and there will be a Palestinian state next to us , then we have to have an understanding that for such a historic compromise , that it is the end of the conflict , that there are no longer Palestinian claims against Israel and that the two states will be living together in peace .
Israeli spokesman Mark Rengav .
Prime Minister Ehud Barak defends Israel 's bombardment of Palestinian targets in the Gaza Strip in response to a bomb attack on a school bus in Gaza that killed two Jewish settlers and injured at least nine , some of them children .
VOA correspondent Eve Connan in Jerusalem reports .
Dozens of people are reported injured in the air raids which Palestinian leaders are calling an act of criminal aggression .
As night fell , Israeli combat helicopters fired dozens of missiles at targets in the Gaza Strip , striking near the office of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat .
Targets included a police station and security headquarters .
Parts of Gaza were plunged into darkness as electricity went off during the raids .
Following the strikes , Prime Minister Ehud Barak warned Israel would use all force necessary with no restraints to end weeks of violence .
He described the bombing of a school bus traveling from a Jewish settlement in the Gaza Strip early Monday , as a barbaric and terrorist act , and said no negotiations were currently underway with the Palestinian leadership .
Earlier , the Palestinian authority issued a statement denying involvement in the school bus attack .
Palestinian leaders accused Israel of choosing a path of war by launching the strikes and called for international intervention .

Democratic reformers are claiming victory in Saturday 's parliamentary elections in Serbia , the dominant republic of Yugoslavia .
Mr. Kostunica told Serbian television today that the election victory will allow the reformers to move swiftly to start building a democratic government in what he called a socially oriented market economy .
VOA 's Barry Wood reports from Belgrade that the elections come less than three months after Slobodan Milosevic was ousted from power when he lost to a reformer in a presidential election .
Reformist Democratic Opposition of Serbia , the DOS , proclaimed victory only hours after the polls closed .
Unofficial results suggest that the reformist coalition will obtain about 65 % and a clear majority in the 250 seat Serbian Parliament .
The Socialist Party of ousted strong man Slobodan Milosevic , appears to be getting 13 % of the vote and is likely to be the largest single party in the Parliament .
Vote counting continues with official results likely no sooner than late Sunday .
Voter turnout was about 60 % less than had been expected .
Reformist leader Zuan Jinjich , who is said to become Serbia 's Prime Minister , called the election a popular mandate for democracy and the free market economy .
He promises to bring Mr. Milosevic to justice and rid the police and judiciary of Milosevic loyalists .
Barry Wood , VOA News , Belgrade .
Former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic won a landslide victory Saturday as he was re-elected leader of the Socialist Party of Serbia .
A defiant Mr. Milosevic made his first public appearance since being deposed in a popular uprising last month .
He told the SPS conference in Belgrade , those who sought his downfall are traitors and agents of Western countries .
Meanwhile , 200 people from North and South Korea are taking part in the second round of family reunions .
The story from VOA 's Alicia Reu .
As in August , communist North Korea is allowing 100 relatives to travel to South Korea 's capital Seoul to visit loved ones they have not seen for five decades .
One hundred South Koreans will be in the northern capital Pyongyang , to meet their North Korean relatives , but South Korean officials say media interest for the upcoming event has dropped substantially .
The government has also cut back on cost and allotted days for the reunions .
Officials say they have reduced the reunion schedule from four days to three and will spend some $ 800,000 to bring the families together , compared to the nearly $ 1.6 million it spent for the August event .
Nevertheless , the reunions represent one of the most tangible signs of thawing between the two cold war enemies .
The North and South Korean leaders agreed to the reunions as part of a broader reconciliation policy at an unprecedented summit in June .

The United States responded cautiously Monday to a declaration by Iraq that it would resume oil exports to fulfill existing contracts .
State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said there is no confirmation as yet that Iraq has in fact begun allowing the loading of oil tankers .
The UN overseers report that Iraq is not allowing loadings into tankers .
We reiterate Iraq is the one who has chosen to suspend oil exports , even though , the Security Council agreed to allow shipments to continue while the UN and Iraq concluded a pricing mechanism to reflect a fair market value for December exports , and once again we make quite clear we continue our work with other governments and with the International Energy Agency , and we are ready to take action to add supply very quickly as this situation should warm up .
On Sunday Iraq backed away from an oil export halt that it had called two days earlier .
It 's now official , former star Mario Lemieux is coming out of retirement to play for the National Ice Hockey League team that he owns , the Pittsburgh Penguins .

Meanwhile Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has held talks with Israeli Foreign Minister Shlomo Ben - Ami in Cairo , but no breakthroughs toward a peace deal were reported .
The meeting , which lasted about two hours , followed Cairo talks earlier Wednesday between Mr. Ben - Ami and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak .
Israeli and Palestinian negotiators have been trying to revive the peace process and reduce Israeli - Palestinian violence that has killed more than 365 people since late September .

Make this final port call for some of these men and women on board who have been there for ten months at sea .
Chad Myers joining me on the set .
Typical perfect day in San Diego waiting for these men and women to come home .
Raining in L.a. , raining in San Francisco but nice in San Diego .
It 's a picture perfect place to live .
72 and sunny just about every day .
Have you ever been down there ?
No , I have not .
It is quite stunning .
It is beautiful out there .
I just think about all the family members sitting at home , sitting on the dock looking at this boat coming in .
It 's just amazing .
They were not on vacation .
They were in danger .
Your loved ones are in danger for ten months .
Is he okay today ?
Is she okay today ?
Incredible sight to see these young men and women .
They are children .
They are 18 , 19 , 20 years old .
Think about when I was 18 , I was thinking about going to college .
These guys are running ships .
Some of these , as you say , are children .
Some of these had children while they were out at sea and this is first opportunity to get home and meet and hold them .
We 've seen the reunions for the past week or so .
It brings a lot of emotion .
It 's going to be hard for me to hold back tears .
We 're watching from the sidelines .
You can just imagine what these people must be thinking and how antsy they must be .
Got to think the last five minutes must feel like five days as they 've spent ten months on the water .
Just about to come home .
Sense the anticipation there beginning to build on those docks .
Friend of mine in Richmond , Virginia , on the radio up there WRBA .
His son was on one of the ships that escorted a carrier , although this came home by itself from Hawaii .
There are so many other ships out there that escort this ship as it goes out .
It 's just not one ship , not just 5,000 people .
It is a battle group that goes out .
Eight , nine , ten ships and a submarine .
While some of these ladies and gentlemen are going to be joining their families half of them are going to stay on board because the `` Lincoln '' is going to be docked in Everett , Washington .

They wo n't get to see their loved ones until Tuesday or Wednesday .
I wonder who gets to get off first .
Is there a drawing ?
Was there a raffle ?
We 've got to deal with the person who 's going to be getting off here .

From Texas politics now to Chinese censorship .
China today blacked out a CNN interview that was critical of the Chinese government 's handling of the SARs epidemic and of the country 's health care system .
China requires foreign broadcasters to use a Chinese satellite to serve their country .
Until last month it was routinely blocking almost all reports about Sars in China , a practice that has produced intense global criticism .
The British Broadcasting Company has also faced the censorship in China .
In 1993 Rupert Murdoch bought a controlling stake in China 's Star TV satellite system .
In 1994 the BBC World Service broadcasts were pulled from Star .
China was offended by the BBC 's news content and demanded that STAR TV remove it or lose permission to broadcast in China .
A year later Murdoch bought the rest of Star TV that he did not own .
Rupert Murdoch 's News Corp. has an extensive presence , of course in this country .
That presence may be expanding soon , if the FCC eases some of its broadcast rules .
Murdoch has lobbied hard for those changes .
They would allow him to buy even more U.S. television stations .
Next month the FCC is likely to accommodate him .
Murdoch today promised that if the rules are changed he will limit future purchases to a few of what he calls sizable markets .
Let 's talk a little bit more about what the Navy does to prevent such tragedies .
We were talking about it this morning and we put together some graphics for you .
I 'll try to explain it the best I can from what I remember from being on the `` USS Abraham Lincoln '' .
This is an amphibious ship , rather , but this is what the Navy does with regard to prevention .
, every sailor that 's entering the Navy does take a swim test .
They learn how to tread water and do the dead man float and they have to pass that in order to continue on .
Also drills take place before sailors get on to any ship , before any deployment .
Usually twice a day , they 're practicing man overboard drills , knowing where to go , where to report to if indeed a man overboard takes place and as the deployment begins , those wane off , but they know where to go quickly .
They also wear float coats .
You can see them here .
The yellow shirt is wearing a yellow float coat .
Everything is color coordinated .
You see the gentleman here wearing a brown one and they have toggles to pull and inflate .
They also have a manual device so if the toggles do n't work they can blow air into the inflation device .
They have dive goggles and they 're able to find them .
It also has a strobe light and a whistle .
Also such location devices , some ships have smoke floats they can toss out so the man overboard will be able to use smoke signals as a way of trying to , let the rescuer locate them .
Also 24 / 7 there are individuals on watch , all throughout the ship , all around the ship , and indeed , there is netting on most parts of the ship , not all around the entire ship , but on most parts there is a very thick netting .
Now let 's talk about the man overboard rescue and when indeed there is a man overboard situation .
You will hear a P.A. announcement around the entire ship , there is a man overboard so everyone knows they have to react quickly .
A ship - wide search will happen if they do n't see that person go overboard , but if indeed they do see someone go overboard , the ship starts to circle that area continuously .
Also small boats sometimes go out into the water , but even more importantly , helicopters are launched immediately .
Inside those helicopters rescue swimmers .
If indeed the man overboard is located , well the hoister is dropped down with usually a torso harness .
If the man overboard is injured then they may use a basket , but more than likely those swimmers will go right into the water and try and help the swimmer hook up on that harness and pull them up into the helo and pull them back on to the ship for treatment and usually a search takes about 24 hours .
The search crews will go 24 hours before calling off that search .
Why call it off ?
There 's a number of reasons to look at .
Depending on the water temperature , it 's very common in cold water that someone will not survive a certain amount of time .
Also the reason for the 24 - hour search is they fail they 've exhausted all resources by that time .
Anyway , we 'll continue to follow what 's happening on the `` USS Nassau '' as those investigations continue for the two missing sailors .
Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and Palestinian Prime Minister Mahmoud Abbas scheduled to meet today , their second chance now to discuss the Bush administration 's road map for Mideast peace .

John Snow making some comments a short time ago saying he backs tougher oversight for the company .
He also says his department is trying to determine if it has implication for the nation 's financial system .
Freddie Mac stock is down another 6.5 % today .
It has lost more than 207 % -- or about 20 % since Monday .
Monday , of course , is when the company fired its President for not cooperating with efforts to restate earnings for the last few years .
Freddie Mac 's Chairman and CEO forced out the same day .
Investors learned last night the CEO is getting a severance package worth $ 24 million .
The ousted President is going to walk away with more than $ 6 million in vested openings .
Yesterday Federal Prosecutions announced a criminal probe into the company .
Probably tough number for the rest of the company employees to hear .
I want to ask you a little bit about cell phones now .
All of us use our phones , I think , maybe too much .
The companies that we pay for probably love it .
Who talks more ?
Men or --
Off the coast there was a dramatic rescue by a cruise ship ship .
Canada TV has the story and some dramatic pictures .
Reporter :
With winds bliping at more than 100 kilometers an hour , three men desperately cling to their sinking fishing boat .
The crew sent out a distress call after it started taking on water .
Suddenly we realized water came into the engine room and it was rising and they started to pump , of course , and they pumped and pumped and the water came more and more and more .
Reporter :
The ship was sinking by the second , and as the waves pounded against them , waiting for help was their only option .
Their life raft had already been snitched away by the high seas .
When we got the information , it was only 23 , 25 miles off , so we were quite close .
Reporter :
Still it took the Royal Caribbean cruise ship `` Raidience of the Seas '' almost an hour to reach the scene and despite the rough ocean , the captain immediately sent a boat in to save them .
They see them .
They see them .
They were jumping in the sea when they saw the rescuers were on the way .
They were swimming toward the boat .
I pulled out the youngest guy first and then I wanted to pull out the captain , but the captain said take --
Dog Chapman was in the same truck you saw .
At one point , the Mexican police busted both Andrew Luster and Dwayne Dog Chapman , because they do n't like bounty hunters in Mexico .
Chapman remains behind bars as we speak in Mexico .
Andrew Luster , though arrived yesterday at Los Angeles International Airport on a commercial flight from Mexico .
As soon as he arrived -- thoom being walked by the FBI to a van belonging to the Ventura County sheriff 's folks .
He was taken to a prison in Kearn County , California , about 100 miles from Los Angeles , a place mostly known for its grapes .
Make of that what you may .

Here 's our story this half hour --
There 's dancing in the streets of Belgrade as angry demonstrations have turned into celebrations .
Tens of thousands of people crowded the streets of the Yugoslavian capital today after the apparent overthrow of President Slobodan Milosevic .
Yesterday , protesters stormed key government buildings and seized Serb state television in Belgrade .
Russia has joined the West in its support of opposition leader Vojislav Kostunica .
Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov congratulated Kostunica on his election victory .
He also gave him a letter from Russian President Vladimir Putin .
Putin says he hopes the opposition leader will do `` everything possible to overcome the internal political crisis '' in Yugoslavia .
Russia was the last European power to withhold support for the opposition .
The man who lost power in Yugoslavia finally surfaced today .
Slobodan Milosevic met with Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov .
Ivanov says Milosevic told him he plans to remain in Serbia and continue to run its largest political party .
Indeed Milosevic still considers himself to be President , according to his brother Borislav .
In an interview with CNN , Borislav Milosevic accused Western nations of supporting the demonstrations and said his brother has no plans to leave the city .
Regardless of how many votes Mr. Kostunica received , the actions that took place last night are vandalism .
It 's violence .
It should n't have happened .
That 's not democracy .
The opposition did n't accept the ruling of the constitutional court and began to storm the parliament , which was not being defended , and inflicted huge material damage , but it also did more damage to our institutions .
The next step in the transition to a new government is for the Yugoslav parliament to convene .
A commission set up to ensure the transfer of power is attempting to call lawmakers to Belgrade for a special session .
Alessio Vinci reports that may not happen until tomorrow because some members of parliament will have to travel to Belgrade from Montenegro .
What is going on right now is intense negotiations with all the members of parliament that were elected on September trying to get the majority needed in order to swear in Vojislav Kostunica as the next President of Yugoslavia .
With the events of the past week in Yugoslavia , the world is getting to know the name of Vojislav Kostunica .
Jonathan Mann takes a look at the man and his politics .
Unlike President Milosevic , he was not a Communist in the long years when party membership was the key to power .
He was not among the prominent opposition figures who have struggled against each other almost as hard as the regime .
He is an orthodox Serb nationalist , but he supports truer democracy for his country and better relations with its neighbors and the West .
Kostunica is a soft - spoken and uncharismatic figure who spent years building the Democratic Party of Serbia and gathering only modest support .
After ten years , people know what are the differences between Milosevic 's policies and ours , what Milosevic was saying and promising and what the opposition parties and I myself was saying in these years and how I was behaving .
Kostunica is 56 , an expert on constitutional law who lives with his wife and pets in a Belgrade apartment .
He was fired from his job teaching law in 1974 for his opposition to the policies of the Tito government .
He refused an offer to return in 1989 because of his opposition to the Milosevic regime , and he rejects much from the West as well -- the Dayton peace accord , Western sanctions on Yugoslavia , and the war crimes tribunal .
In the months before the election , he was careful to distinguish between his support for European aid projects tied to reform and U.S. efforts , which he describes as unhelpful , even to the opposition .
I know what the support means when we get from European Union , the programs like energy for democracy , school for democracy .
Those small projects .
Here we get nothing in advance , just a political support which consists of nothing , and which is mostly used and abused and manipulated by the regime , saying they are just NATO parties , as is often said by regime , they are not having their own policy .

17 crew members were killed and 39 injured in last month 's apparent terrorist bombing of the warship .
The United Nations Security Council has passed a resolution condemning what it calls `` acts of violence , especially the excessive use of force against Palestinians . ''

The Security Council vote was unanimous , with the United States abstaining .
President Clinton may travel to North Korea in an attempt to improve relations with that country .
The announcement comes after two days of talks between American and North Korean leaders in Washington .

The investigation into who was behind the apparent suicide attack is being headed by the New York office of the FBI .
Two amphibious assault ships are on the scene to offer security and logistical help in the recovery effort .
A third ship will arrive tomorrow along with a Navy tugboat .
28 of the 33 wounded sailors have been released from the Portsmouth Naval Hospital in Virginia , and four of the most seriously wounded sailors are flying home from Germany for additional treatment .
The FBI says its New York office will lead the agency 's investigation into the Cole bombing .
It 's the same office that 's investigated similar terrorist attacks , including those linked to ex-Saudi millionaire Osama Bin Laden .
Yesterday , Afghanistan 's ruling Taliban denied Bin Laden 's involvement in the Yemeni attack .
Bin Laden , who has been living in exile in Afghanistan , is of Yemeni descent .
Investigators do not say whether they have found a link between him and the attack , but say they 're looking at a range of possible suspects .
Hello , everyone .

While leaders and spokesmen for both sides talk , the fighting goes on .
Richard Blystone reports on the latest round of violence in the Mideast .
The studied words of the diplomats and the cries in the street seem to come from two different worlds .
Fresh clashes in the Gaza Strip on the Mediterranean coast and in the West Bank .
Fighting springs from the funerals for at least nine Palestinians killed Friday in some of the worst clashes in this three - week conflict .
A new intifada , successor to the four - year street campaign that ended with Palestinian / Israeli negotiations a decade ago , according to a leader of Yasser Arafat 's Fateh movement .

The morning papers , because morning papers around the country and around the world are remaking their front page to include the Elizabeth Smart case , and we end with that tonight .
With her family on a day when their miracle finally came true .
She looks very , very healthy .
She 's grown a lot , and I 'm just so absolutely thrilled .
I could n't believe it .
In fact , I had to take a double take and pull her back away from me and say , `` is it really you ? ''
All of the children out there deserve to come home to their parents the way Elizabeth has come back to us , and I just hope and pray that Congress will quickly pass the Amber Alert so that those children will have a better chance because they cross the state line and they 're out of commission , and we need to have this here , we really do .
But I just am so grateful and so thankful .
Thank you very much .
Reporter :
Can you describe Elizabeth 's demeanor ?
You said she looked good , she was bigger , but she 's been through this horrible ordeal .
Is she still scared ?
She excited ?
Happy ?
I do n't know .
I mean , I 'm sure she was just thrilled to be back .
such happiness and such love .
And I just held her , held her the whole way home .
I just brought her little brother William in , and as William and she saw each other , it was such a wonderful reunion for them to just hug , and he would hug her and look at her and hug her and look at her , and could n't believe , I think , as a 4 - year - old now that his sister is home .
With the darkness that surrounds us in these times of the possibility of war that could be coming upon us and a miracle that has been brought to us , an incredible miracle that has been brought to our family , words can not express how grateful we are for the prayers around the world .
Do miracles still exist ?
And the answer is yes .
And we have Elizabeth back .
This neighborhood , the Federal Heights neighborhood , everybody 's been ripped up , everybody 's helped , everybody 's prayed to do whatever they can .
We thank God for all the searchers , for all the people .
In the history of the world I do n't think a little girl 's been prayed for more than Elizabeth Smart , and we thank you for answering those prayers .
Thank you .
It 's a nice day to have this job .
We 'll see you tomorrow , 10:00 Eastern time .

We 're getting late word tonight that Geraldo Rivera may not be be kicked out of Iraq after all .
Originally the Central Command said the veteran Fox News correspond was being expelled because he compromised the location of the unit he 's been embedded with .
Now a spokesman from the Central Command is saying and I 'm quoting `` Frankly , we have bigger and more important things to do . ''
During a live broadcast Geraldo drew a map in the sand showing the location of the unit in relation to Baghdad .
Says he 's not aware he 's being expelled but says if so , it is because some bitter former colleagues of his at MSNBC blew the whistle on him .
It sounds to me like some rats at my former network , NBC , are spreading some lies about me .
You know , they ca n't compete fair and square on the battlefield so they 're trying to stab me in the back .
It is not first time .
The Central Command on the other hand says Rivera is being kicked out of Iraq because `` he gave away the big picture stuff . ''
All of this now under review , whether or not Geraldo stays or goes .
We 'll continue to monitor that front on the store yix another veteran war correspondent is being fired for his controversial conduct in Iraq .
NBC is terminating freelancer reporter Peter Arnett for statements he made to the Iraqi media .
We showed you the statements yesterday .
He said the coalition 's first war plan had failed because of Iraqi resistance .
Today he appeared on NBC 's `` Today '' show and said he was sorry .
I want to apologize to the American people for clearly making a misjudgment over the weekend by giving an interview to Iraqi television .
Now , I said in that interview essentially what we all know about the war , there have been delays in implementing policy , there has been surprises , but clearly by giving that interview to Iraqi television , I created a firestorm in the United States , and for that I am truly sorry .
Arnett had been covering the war for National Geographic , which also fired him as TV reports were given exclusively to NBC and MSNBC .
Late word from London that the tabloid the Daily Mirror just hired Peter Arnett to be its correspondent in Baghdad .
But the question remains Did Peter Arnett and Geraldo Rivera cross the line ? or were they within their rights as reporters ?
We posed that question to Michael Wolf , a contributing editor for `` New York '' magazine , a media columnist , an important article in the new issue of `` New York . ''
He 's joining us now live from Qatar .
What do you say to the question , Michael ?
Well , you know , I think I 'm --
We turn now to an Iraqi --
First of all , before we tell you about this story , we were going to , these are live pictures from Baghdad .
There 's been some activity in the last few moments .
Looks like tracer fire we 're looking at , anti-aircraft guns firing at what they sense is some sort of threat coming from the skies .
Baghdad has had sporadic episodes of this tonight .
No major explosions we 're aware of , but just , apparently , in the last few moments , there has been activity .
You can see it there just now .
We 've been reporting , the city has begun to see its electricity turned back on .
We do n't know that all of it is back , but at least some of it is .
We also know that 12 miles southwest of the city , coalition forces remain largely in control of what was formerly Saddam Hussein International Airport , now renamed by the coalition Baghdad International Airport , but the coalition is quick to point out that they do not have control of the area immediately surrounding the airport .
Again , these are live pictures of Baghdad , where it is well into the night .
We 're , of course , going to keep monitoring the situation there and bring you up to speed on anything we learn .
In northern Iraq , U.S. warplanes hit targets including a ridge east of Mosul , where Iraqi troops have been entrenched .
Two F Tomcats struck the targets .
The same area was a site of heavy bombing yesterday .
After today 's air strikes , 13 Iraqi soldiers abandoned their posts and surrendered to Kurdish fighters .
Until southern Iraq , another symbol of Saddam Hussein 's regime is in ruins tonight .
Saddam Hussein 's private yacht and quite a yacht it is or was , it was hit by coalition bombs and missiles and then burned and looted by Iraqis .
The boat was one of the world 's most luxurious yachts when it was launched some 20 years ago .
Now the scorched hulk floats aimlessly in the Arab waterway next to Basra 's dock yards .
People in Baghdad celebrate the fall of a leader whose fate is unknown tonight .
We 'll be talking with an expert on Saddam Hussein , author Andrew Coburn about whether Saddam Hussein is dead or alive and where in the world is he .
Also , the long journey of the marine who covered the statue of Saddam Hussein with an American flag , Bill Tucker will have a special report on the life of marine corporal Edward Chin , and actress Jane Fonda is now questioning freedom of the United States , and she has a few thoughts about ignorance .

She said she felt vindicated when he admitted under oath that he 'd had an affair with her after denying it for years .
Flowers has written two books , both of which are for sale on her website , along with private - label cigars and signed photos .

If nine caroling cats crooning Christmas classics does n't put you in the holiday mood , maybe nothing will .
Yes , it 's that time of year .
The Jingle Cats are back , and can be found just about anywhere .
They have cassettes and and their very own video , which is also out on DVD .
The man behind the music , creator Mike Spalla , says he owes it all to his cat , Cheesepuff , and her finely tuned vocal cords .
I was hired to do some Christmas music , and it was just `` Jingle Bells , '' and I brought my cat with me to the studio , and I was working on the song and the cat jumped up into the record booth and started meowing along , meowing to me .
7777
Cheesepuff and friends first clawed their way onto the music charts in 1993 with the release of their `` meowy Christmas '' CD , featuring 20 classic Christmas hits .
It was such a success , the following year , the feline group released another holiday song collection , `` Here Comes Santa Claws . ''
Spalla says they have a following of some very unique fans .
There 's a certain kind of person that 's in tune with a cat .
They 're thoughtful .
They must be more intelligent or something .

President Clinton is questioning the legitimacy of George W. Bush 's election victory .
Speaking last night to Democratic supporters in Chicago , the President said Bush won the election only because Republicans stopped the vote - counting in Florida , and Mr. Clinton praised Al Gore 's campaign manager , Bill Daley , for the way he handled the election .
I want to thank Bill Daley for his exemplary service as Secretary of Commerce .
He was brilliant .
I think he did a brilliant job in leading Vice President Gore to victory myself .
Al Gore is spending the Thanksgiving holiday in Washington with his family .
Yesterday , he and his wife , Tipper , made their annual visit to a local food bank .
The Vice President joked whether volunteers ought to recount the boxes of food .
Gore also says he 's focusing on building a possible administration , a move he thinks George W. Bush should make as well , in spite of the election uncertainty .
Hi .
Thanks for looking in .
Our top story this half hour -- sources tell CNN President Clinton and independent counsel Robert Ray have reached an accommodation that would end the long - running investigation of the Clinton White House .
Details are to be announced at this hour by the White House .
Mr. Clinton is expected to admit when he gave sworn testimony in August 1998 , he knowingly misled investigators looking into the Paula Jones and Monica Lewinsky matters .
In return , sources say Mr. Clinton will not be indicted that is he would avoid being indicted .
He also would accept a five - year suspension of his Arkansas law license .
The deal would bring an end to seven years of investigations , covering the Whitewater land deal , Travelgate , and the sexual affair with Monica Lewinsky which led to Mr. Clinton 's impeachment .

In the waters off the coast of Yemen , two urgent missions tonight collecting evidence from the suicide bombing and retrieving bodies still buried in debris .
316 were aboard the `` USS Cole '' when the terrorists struck .
Dozens were injured .
17 were killed .
Our coverage begins with NBC 's Joe Johns .
A plane carrying the bodies of five dead American sailors from the `` USS Cole '' arrived today at Dover Air Force Base , as the first wave of forensics experts and investigators from the Department of Defense and the FBI arrived in Yemen .
Their mission -- to continue the search for evidence and suspects in the explosion .
Also on the way , equipment to lift the `` Cole '' out of the water and specialists to help retrieve the bodies of those trapped and presumed dead .
We know there are spaces that are inaccessible .
We know there are some remains in those spaces .
We need to get in those and locate the remains that we anticipate finding there .
Though the work was only beginning , a top Justice Department official in Washington predicted the outcome of the investigation .
I 'm confident that we will be able to determine who was behind the bombing and that those people , those organizations , will be held accountable , they will be punished .
This critical phase of the investigation must be conducted both above and beneath the water on a tight time line .
They 'll want to get in there quickly because one of the problems when you 're dealing with seawater is that it will have an adverse effect on your evidence .
To further speed up the process , the FBI has now activated the Strategic Information and Operation Center in Washington , conceived after the bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania , ensuring the fastest possible exchange of information between investigators and the decision makers .
On the diplomatic front , the U.S. said the government of Yemen is cooperating with the investigation , though that country 's President disputes charges that his nation is a haven for terrorists .
The Justice Department says no group or individual has been ruled out as a suspect , though many expect that whoever gets the blame will eventually be tied to the terrorist Osama bin Laden .
And the grieving continued today at the Naval Academy 's football game against Notre Dame .
A moment of silence to remember the victims of this terrorist act .
Joe Johns , NBC News .
The `` USS Cole '' is on its long journey home tonight , sitting atop a rescue ship , and now , for the first time , its open wound fully visible .
NBC 's Jim Miklaszewski tonight at the Pentagon with an exclusive report on the damage done and the difficulty in finding those responsible .
Jim ?
What 's the latest there ?
New pictures reveal the sheer power of that terrorist bomb that ripped through the `` USS Cole . ''
For the first time , with the `` Cole '' out of the water , the full impact of the catastrophic blast clearly visible .
In these photos obtained by NBC News , the damage much larger than first imagined , extending well below the water line .
Workers on deck dwarfed by the 40 x 60 - foot gaping wound .
Large sections of the hull buckled inward .
Crewman Sean Powell , back home in Florida , says inside the `` Cole , '' it was chaos , it got dark , we lost power , ship started to list , that 's what scared everybody .
Despite the devastating damage , Navy officials predict the `` Cole '' can be repaired for about $ 150 million , and put back into service .
Justice Department officials say in Yemen , the FBI 's investigation is dead in the water .
Senior U.S. officials tell NBC News the Yemen government has all but shut down all cooperation in finding those behind the `` Cole '' attack .
Evidence is either withheld or tampered with .
A surveillance video of the harbor at the time of the attack was so heavily edited , it did n't even show the blast itself .
Why ?
Yemen is a terrorist hotbed , and some members of President Saleh 's own cabinet have direct ties to radical Islamic extremists and terrorists .
It 's hard to see exactly why it is that the President there would ever want to cooperate with the United States and possibly put himself in jeopardy .
Reporter :
And even though cooperation from Yemen is at a standstill , U.S. officials tell NBC News that they are making substantial progress in the investigation and are fully confident they will get enough evidence to retaliate against those responsible .
Tom ?
Thanks very much , NBC 's Jim Miklaszewski tonight .
The nation 's highest court will take up the case next week .
That development may not be as significant as it seems .
Joining me now is law professor Rick Pildes , a consultant to NBC News .
Could a decision from the U.S. Supreme Court settle this case once and for all ?
At this stage , any decision from the U.S. Supreme Court is almost certainly not going to provide a final resolution of this election dispute .
Indeed , the issue is so narrow now before the Supreme Court that whichever way the court rules , it will likely have only the most marginal impact on what 's going on in Florida .
Even if the Bush campaign prevails before the Supreme Court , it simply means we will move more quickly into the contest phase of the litigation or the next stage of the litigation .
But you believe the fact that the U.S. Supreme Court just decided to hear this case is a partial victory for both Bush and Gore .
It is a partial victory for both sides .
For the last two weeks , the central constitutional argument the Bush campaign has been making to the federal courts is , stop these manual recounts now , they violate the Constitution .
The U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear that part of the case , agreeing with all the other federal judges who have unanimously held that this is not the proper time for federal court intervention .
So in that sense , a victory for the Gore campaign .
For the Bush campaign , a victory in the willingness of the Supreme Court to play some role in overseeing the Florida system and the Florida judicial decision making process .
Whatever the Supreme Court decides this time , you say this case could come back before the U.S. Supreme Court again ?
John , if the Supreme Court of the United States is to play a final and decisive role in this dispute , that role is going to come at the end of the Florida judicial process , not at this stage .
Law professor Rick Pildes , thank you .
It will be one of the first election returns on Tuesday .
It will also be among the most important .
As we continue our coverage of presidential politics with a look at the last - minute battle to win a crucial swing state , Florida .
25 electoral votes .
It 's being fought over hard .
With a look at how the candidates are getting out the vote there , here 's NBC News correspondent Kerry Sanders .
The image of Florida , both fact and fiction .
A great getaway , a state where a mouse wields more power than a tropical paradise .
While the mild winters make this comfortable living for almost three million seniors , the largest elderly population in the United States , this year it is not the weather drawing Al Gore and George W. Bush to the Sunshine State .
Both candidates list 25 reasons to keep coming back , Florida 's 25 electoral votes .
Polls show Florida is still up for grabs .
Both candidates have been here almost equally .
In fact , it 's almost I dare you politics .
Each of them dares the other one to spend less time , money , and energy than they are at their own peril .
Elderly voters once again in Florida , the most important voting bloc because they actually vote more than any other group .
In this election , 45 % of those going to the voting booth are expected to be over the age of 65 .
The issue most important to them , Social Security .
Pay down the nation 's debt , strengthen Social Security , cut taxes for middle class family , save our environment .
Experience .
Vision .
Values .
Al Gore .
Why does Al Gore say one thing when the truth is another ?
His attacks on George Bush 's Social Security plan , exaggerations .
The truth , nonpartisan analysis confirms George Bush 's plan sets aside $ 2.4 trillion to strengthen Social Security .
Both candidates repeatedly talking about that one issue , but in Florida where there are more than 550 children born every day , families drive the other campaign issues .
Polls show education , the environment , and the candidate 's character will influence who voters choose .
And in this diverse state with a 15 % Hispanic population , both candidates courting their votes in ways not seen in any previous election .
Following both conventions , Gore and Bush granted their first live TV interviews to this man .
His name , Jorge Ramos , the Tom Brokaw of Spanish language news .
The race gets really , really close , and let 's suppose that states like Florida and Illinois might decide the election .
maybe , maybe Hispanic votes might decide , too , who would be the next President of the United States .
The largest Hispanic voting bloc of Florida , Republican voters who do not seem to be crossing the party line .
Gore wanted the young Cuban boy , Elian Gonzalez to stay in this country .
Joe Lieberman brings Gore support he probably would have gotten here anyway .
Sizable Jewish and African - American voting blocs .
Of the 10 largest states , Florida is the most Republican .
The Republican governor here , Jeb Bush was once expected to deliver his brother this state .
The managers of both campaigns saying in the end , the wipper may simply be determined by who gets more people to the voting booth .
Kerry Sanders , NBC News , Anaheim .
There was , of course , a team of attorneys on both sides of this live network coverage over the weekend of this trial going on in the courtroom in Florida , and , of course , among the teams of lawyers on the Bush side , one of the leaders , Ben Ginsberg , one of the lawyers who argued the case in Leon County Circuit Court .
He 's with us tonight , victorious in Tallahassee , Florida , and Ben , whatever the outcome today , and you were on the upside , you are forced now to go along with the appeals process as is the right of the Gore team .
What is your reaction to the work that will cause ?
Well , I mean , we 're certainly prepared to brief all the issues .
I think that the circuit court judge , Judge Sauls gave a very well reasoned and thorough , both legal and factual discussion of Florida law .
Well , let 's talk about your statement earlier today that the Vice President -- I guess you were asked should the Vice President concede , and you answered , the Vice President should do what 's best for the United States .
Is that what you 're trying to say ?
Well , sure .
I mean , I think that all the people involved in this unique situation , the first time a presidential election in our history has been contested , Brian , need to do the right thing , and I 'm sure do the right thing , as they see fit .
Do you think the judge there , in addition to just giving out his ruling at the end of the court session today , he went on beyond the basic issues and added reason upon reason for why he turned down the Gore case .
Do you think his method there was to try to make this more or less appeal proof ?
Well , I think what he did was addressed the situation as it exists in Florida and addressed the contingencies that were raised in the voluminous briefs that he had , not only from the two party candidates involved , but also of the interveners who were in the case .
As you know , the Democratic line throughout is they wo n't be happy until every vote is counted , and we could n't help but notice , should we call it a rhetorical device you used when talking to reporters this afternoon .
Pause and listen along with us to the following piece of videotape .
Those ballots have been counted not once on election night but twice in the recount and how many did you say there were ?
10,750 --
If you know the exact number , does n't that mean they 've been counted ?
So I do n't suppose that was any accident on your part ?
Well , they have been making this point throughout these proceedings that these ballots have never been counted , and that is factually not true .
They have been counted on election night -- they 've been counted in the recounts , and it simply happens to be not the case that those ballots have failed to be counted by anyone .
Ben , for better or worse , you are forced now to follow the Gore team as they take you on a kind of trail of appeal here .
If you were asked to predict whether this stops at the Florida or U.S. Supreme Court , what would your prediction be ?
I think it 's one of those situations where I would have predicted all , Brian .
I think that the decisions are not ours to make .
We 'll be involved in all the legal processes obviously as long as the Gore campaign keeps them up , no matter how long that takes .
Ben Ginsberg , attorney for the Bush team , victorious today in Tallahassee .
Thank you very much , after a long day , for being with us tonight .
Thanks , Brian .
The head of the Palestinian Television and Radio has been shot dead in the Gaza Strip .
Masked gunmen opened fire on Hisham Mekki at a hotel in Gaza City but the motive for the attack is unclear .
You 're listening to BBC News .
The Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak is due to meet with Egypt 's President Mubarak in Cairo on Thursday .
The encounter is being seen as an effort by Barak to drum up regional support for a Middle East peace agreement based on President Clinton 's proposals .
They require Israel to relinquish sovereignty over most of Arab East Jerusalem and the Palestinians to scale back their demand for a return of refugees , but Palestinian chief negotiator Sayeb Erekat says more details are required before both sides can strike a deal .
We have so many questions that we have ... so many points that need to be clarified .
The most important thing is the clarity .
The most important thing is that we focus on the travails of the peace process .
Israeli settlers are worried that most of the settlements in the West Bank will be dismantled if an agreement is reached .
The spokeswoman for this Settlers ' Council Yahudi Tayar says this is unacceptable .
We have a situation where instead of protecting the interests of the Jewish people , the Israeli Prime Minister is willing to forgo on all of the vital and important areas and not only our history , but the security of the future for the Jewish people in Israel .
More than 300 people have been killed in the West Bank and Gaza Strip since September .

Both George W. Bush and Al Gore today continue to press their cases literally and figuratively .
Their PR machines seem to be functioning smoothly .
Governor Bush 's running mate Dick Cheney talked with reporters about the Republican transition plans , another signal that Bush is getting ready to become the next President of the United States .
Meanwhile , Vice President Gore continued his appeal for patience while he contests Bush 's claim to victory , and attorneys for both men were preparing for key court battles later in the week , which could settle the three - week dispute over who won Florida and the presidency .
The World 's Clark Boyd has the latest .
All eyes were on Florida yet again today as lawyers , judges , lawmakers and citizens , all picked at the knots that have tied up the conclusion of this presidential election for the past three weeks .
Yesterday in Leon County Circuit Court , Judge N. Sander Sauls set a Saturday deadline for a hearing on vote recounts and ordered the roughly 14000 contested ballots in Miami Dade and Palm Beach counties , not to mention a sample voting machine and voting booth , to be brought to Tallahassee under police escort .
Today , as officials in both two counties ready the ballots for transport , George W. Bush 's lawyers asked the judge to order all 1.16 million ballots from the two counties to be trucked to the state capital .
Late this afternoon , Judge Sauls granted that motion .
In Washington , Vice President Al Gore was back on television this morning trying to shore up public support for his legal cause .
In a taped interview , for NBC 's Today Show , Gore said despite all the legal maneuvering he is calling on both camps to put partisan politics aside .
I think that both Governor Bush and I should recognize an obligation during this time when the votes are still to be counted , to try to restrain the passions of our partisan supporters .
Meanwhile , Bush 's vice presidential candidate Dick Cheney was a busy man today .
After a heart checkup at a Washington hospital he appeared at a news conference to say that he is pressing ahead with transition plans .
We have now acquired office space in McClain , Virginia that will become the site for the transition operation that we announced two days ago , so we are just in a business of getting up and running , but we now have an office with a lot of space .
We have got people signing up , volunteers coming on , telephones being put in and computers , so we will be fully operational within the next day or two .
Earlier today in Florida , the Republican dominated legislature began hearings on calling a special session to pick the state 's electors itself , should the December 12th deadline still find the election tied up in the courts .
The committee heard from angry voters and precinct workers in Palm Beach .
I believe our issues do relate directly to the appointing of electors for the state of Florida .
The electors need to be appointed , are supposed to be appointed according to the will of the people and I believe in Palm Beach County that it was very difficult to determine what the will of the people was .
Although Al Gore said today that he certainly feels like he won the election , he put his odds of wining the various legal battles at fifty - fifty .
Gore said , if Bush does triumph in court , he will throw his support behind the Republican President - elect .
But for now , says former Clinton administration cabinet member Robert Riche , both sides are positive that they 've won the election , and says Riche , the longer the fight goes on , the more troublesome the next four years might be .
What we risk by prolonging this is greater public cynicism and a hardening of partisan lines among career politicians who have to work together .
After all , come January , these people are going to have to be in Washington whether Gore or Bush is the President .
You have a lot of politicians in Congress who are going to have to work together with the new President and with each other , so we do n't want to prolong this forever .
The US Supreme Court will hear arguments from both sides on Friday and Florida 's Leon County Circuit Court will consider the arguments on disputed state ballots on Saturday , and while the nation wearies of the protracted legal battle maybe Leon County Circuit Court judge N. Sander Sauls said it best .
The whole process , he said , is a bit like being nibbled to death by a duck .
For The World , this is Clark Boyd .
Russia 's lower house of parliament has overwhelmingly approved restoring the former Soviet anthem as the Russian national anthem .
The move had the strong support of Russian President Vladimir Putin who said use of the old anthem represented a gesture of reconciliation .
Critics argued that the anthem is a throwback to the former totalitarian government .
The anthem will have new words , eliminating verses that praised Communist leaders Vladimir Lenin and Joseph Stalin .
The lower house of parliament also gave formal endorsement to Russia 's white , red and blue flag but reinstated the old red and gold Soviet flag as the flag of the military .

The Yugoslav Army has given its support to President - elect Vojislav Kostunica .
Earlier he had an hour long meeting with former President Slobodan Milosevic .
It 's the first meeting since Milosevic was ousted by a popular revolt .
He conceded defeat and congratulated his successor .
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright says , the lifting of international sanctions against Serbia can now be discussed .
Our sanctions regime is not against the people of Serbia , it was against Milosevic , and if Milosevic is gone then there are many ways that the sanctions regime can be changed and lifted and adjusted .
Albright says Milosevic must not be allowed to maintain any position of power .
Earlier Russia also recognized Kostunica as Yugoslavia 's new leader .
Visiting Foreign Minister Evan Holf told Milosevic his time is up .
From BBC news in London , I am Gregor Cragey for The World .
George W. Bush has met with Al Gore in Washington .
The two men met for just 15 minutes at the Vice President 's official residence .
It 's the first time they 've been face to face since the bitterly contested presidential election was finally concluded last week .
Bush went into the talks with his defeated rival after meeting with President Clinton earlier today .
At a photo opportunity in the Oval Office , Bush thanked the President and fended off an interruption from a veteran White House correspondent .
I am humbled and honored , and I ca n't thank the President enough for his hospitality .
He did n't need to do this .
Yes , he did .
I have n't quite finished yet .
And I am grateful and I am going to look forward to the discussion .
I am here to listen .
For his part President Clinton said his only advice to Bush is to assemble a good team and to do what he thinks is right .
Bush is now heading back to Texas .

Novelist and playwright Gao Xingjian today became the first Chinese language author to win the Nobel Prize for Literature .
Gao Xingjian 's avant - garde plays made him persona non-grata in his native China and he fled the country in 1988 .
He settled in France becoming a French citizen two years ago .
Gregory Lee is a professor of Chinese and Chinese literature at the University of Lyons in France .
Professor Lee , I gather you know the man and know his work .
Tell us a little bit about him , Who is he and why did he flee China .
Gao Xingjian is quite an interesting writer because in some senses he differs from the great cohort of contemporary Chinese writers that are well known in the West today .
I would say that the great difference about Gao Xingjian is that he actually received a university education .
He was educated in French , so has a very good knowledge of French literature and it is very much French literature that has influenced his own literary creativities , only free production , so much so that conservative Chinese critics would accuse him of blind worship of Western models .
Sartre is a big man in Mr. Xingjian 's life , is n't he ?
I would say so that Sartre has been a quite a big influence .
I think the other influences would be Samuel Beckett , the Irish and French language writer , Unesco .
These are models and , of course , all of these writers are writers who were active in the first half of the twentieth century .
Well , this is very interesting because Mr. Gao left China before Tianenmen .
He wrote a play , in particular about the events there .
Would you say that his influences may be more French literary then they were his own immediate life experience ?
I would say both , in fact , because the first play that he wrote that made him famous was a play that dates from 1981 , which was actually called ` Bus Stop ' , which many people said or had resonances from Beckett 's play ` Waiting for Godot ' and it concerned a number of Chinese people from different walks of life who were standing at a bus stop waiting for a bus that never came .
So , we can see immediately that the resonances with the play of Beckett , but Gao Xingjian really before 1989 felt , that he was unable to write and to have his plays produced , as he would wish , and so left China couple of years before the incident at Tiananmen in 1989 .
I think it is a great day for modern Chinese literature and it is a day that has been awaited for the past 60 to 70 years .
Gregory Lee is a professor of Chinese and Chinese literature at the University of Lyons , France .
He spoke to us from his home in Provence .
Professor , thank you very much for speaking with us .
Not at all .
Thank you very much .

There are mounting allegations of police and military brutality in Zimbabwe .
But President Robert Mugabe has deployed troops to quell rioting over the rising price of food .
There are sharp increases here just as Zimbabwe has slumped into its worst economic crisis since becoming independent in 1980 .
In three days of unrest Army helicopters have dropped teargas in poor suburbs of the capital Harare , but many of those protesting say they wo n't stop until Mugabe , the man they blame for the country 's economic problems , surrenders the presidency .
From Harare the BBC 's Grant Ferrett reports .
Protestors in one of Harare 's poor southern townships run for cover as riot police fire teargas from the top of an armored vehicle .
Such confrontations have been taking place all over the south of the capital for several days .
The aim is twofold , to demand a halt to the rising prices of basics such as food , fuel and transport , as well as the resignation of President Mugabe .
People are demonstrating for the price increase fuel and everything .
They are trying to stay away .
They do n't want to go to work .
They want to stay away .
So what happened here , can you tell me ?
We set a barricade , not for our people but for the police .
We do n't want them .
We want them to go .
And what have the police done ?
They are rounding up people to clear our barricade , forcing them , beating them , throwing teargas canisters into school children , but the war here has just started .
Nearly four months after Zimbabwe 's bloodiest parliamentary elections , the economy has gone from bad to worse .
President Mugabe 's vitriolic attacks on the west combined with continuing lawlessness , particularly on white owned commercial farms have driven away donors , investors and tourists .
Zimbabwe now has Africa 's fastest shrinking economy .
Many of us like to characterize Zimbabwe 's crisis as an economic crisis but it is wider and deeper than economy .
Simba Makoni looks and sounds like an opposition politician .
In fact , he is the recently appointed finance minister .
You can see the price of bread go up , you can see your bus fares go up , you can see companies closing down or working short weeks and that sort of thing , but you can also read Zimbabwe 's crisis in the number of destitute people on the streets , in the number of crimes being committed .
245 !
245 !
Zimbabwe earns the bulk of its hard currency here on the tobacco auction floors .
This year 's crop is down because of the continuing occupation of white owned farms .
When the selling season ends next month , foreign exchange reserves , hardly estimated to cover just a few days of imports , are likely to completely dry up .
Without them , paying for central imports such as fuel and electricity will become even more difficult .
What we have right now is a political crisis and until that political crisis is resolved , there is no way the economy is going to improve .
The sentiments of economist Howard Setoli are widely shared .
With eighteen months to go until scheduled presidential elections , Zimbabwe is headed for complete economic ruin .
If government continues on its current path , the economy will continue to contract .
This year it was expected to contract by 8 % .
Next year we see a further contraction of 12 % .
So we are talking of massive unemployment , severe foreign exchange shortage .
It is an alarming prediction .
For those taking part in the protests on the streets , after two decades in office they want President Mugabe to go now .
We want a new President .
The situation is like Yugoslavia now .
We do n't want Mugabe .
No more .

Clashes between Israeli Army units and Palestinians have continued into the night .
That 's after another day of violence in which four Palestinians were killed .
Helicopter gunships were deployed around the West Bank village of Bagella .
Exchanges of fire between Israelis and Palestinians have also been reported around Jericho , Greg Barrow reports .
A day of violence across the West Bank and Gaza has been followed by more clashes after nightfall .
Houses in the West Bank village of Bagella have been attached by Israeli helicopter gunships .
An Israeli military spokesman said they were deployed in response to gun fire from Palestinians inside Bagella , which was aimed at the Jewish settlement of Kilo .
The Israelis say the helicopters went into action firing machine guns , but unconfirmed reports from inside Bagella suggested rockets may have been used .

Well we ca n't tell you who won Florida , but in a moment we will enter the musical question , who let the dogs out ?
First up we have the answer to our geo quiz today .
We are looking for a region of central Italy bordering the Adriatic Sea .
The area is mostly mountainous and includes Mt. Corno , the highest peak of the Apennines .
It also includes a lot of sheep , good clean - living , healthy sheep , and an Italian entrepreneur has an idea about how to make a little money of them .
The answer is Abruzzo .
Journalist Carlos Depalazai was in Rome , Italy and Carlo how does this fellow plan to profit from the sheep of the Abruzzo ?
He is taking advantage of two crazes that we are having in the Italy at the moment , one is internet , the other one is the awareness on food .
So this guy came up with the idea of having people adopting sheep by an internet .
So you can have access through your computer on your desk .
Go to the web site of these guys and you can have look at the face of sheep which are available to be adopted .
So what does it mean to adopt a sheep , to show up on your back step or do you , somehow keep track of its progress on the farm in Italy ?
You are not actually adopting the sheep in the sense that you can have it with you .
It looks like distant adoption , where you do n't actually have the child in your home .
You are just contributing with a certain amount of money and you are monitoring the growing up .
It works in the same way , so you have access on the web site of this little farm , in a little village of Abrutzi and you can choose among many , many sheeps and after contributing with a certain amount of money the sheep is actually yours .
All right , so the amount of money you have mentioned to us is about 160 US dollars and for that you get more than just a warm and fuzzy feeling .
You can also receive leggings that are made from wool of the sheep and even if you like some of the sheep dropping delivered to your door .
Yeah , I mean this is quite funny , but apart from all the details , which are sometimes even strange I think what is really important is that it is a sign of a new concern that is effecting Italian people .
I mean we are notoriously lover of good food .
We have a generous attitude towards food , and this is a new stuff .
The fact that you really care about a sheep in the way she is fed , in the way she is nurtured , in the way people are looking after it , because it 's a way to ensure that you have something which is genuine on your table up the end .
Wait a minute , you said that on your table at the end .
Yeah , at the table if it becomes food for instance , which is an option .
You are adopting the sheep and whatever happens at the end it 's your choice and among the option is you know food for your meal .
That kind of puts a whole new tone to this thing .
I mean usually when you think of this kind of adoption that means saving an animal not eventually eating it .
I mean this is an option which is available and I think it is a sort of provocation .
You know Italians now mainly live in metropolitan areas in big cities like Rome , Florence , Naples .
In the past , we were a population of shepherds or farmers .
We had completely different attitude towards nature .
It seems that we are losing something , and we need to reestablish a better relationship with nature and the simple fact that the Environment Minister in Italy supported the initiative and he himself adopted a sheep is significant .
He took advantage immediately of these ideas to build up a new awareness and a new attitude of Italians towards nature and farms .
Carlo De Blazia , journalist speaking to us from Rome .
Thank you very much Carlo .
Nice to talk to you .
Thank you .
Five years ago today , the agreement ending the war in Bosnia was initialed in Dayton Ohio .
Western leaders were n't wild about relying on Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to help implement the accord , but they felt they had no choice .
Five years later , the West and the United States in particular are n't counting on the deposed leader for anything .
They want to see his successor Vojislav Kostinica extradite Milosevic through the International War Crimes Tribunal in The Hague , but not only is Milosevic still living comfortable in Belgrade , last night he made his first TV appearance in six weeks , giving a pep talk to his supporters .
The World 's Jeb Sharp reports on the still unresolved fate of Slobodan Milosevic .
He 's kept Western diplomats spinning in circles for more than a decade .
Five years ago they were negotiating with Milosevic at Dayton to stop the war in Bosnia .
Two years ago they were still shuttling back and forth to Belgrade in an effort to solve the Kosovo crisis .
By March of last year they had given up talking and Nato had started bombing instead .
When Milosevic was indited on war crimes charges soon after , US and other Western officials began calling for his arrest and transfer to The Hague , but now that a delicate transition is underway in Serbia , those calls have grown quieter , according to Gary Bass , the author of the new book about war crimes trials , ` Stay , the Hand of Vengeance ' .
Even Madeleine Albright , who is with the President who is usually most decipherous about the importance of prosecuting war criminals , has in fact said that our first priority is making sure that Vojislov Kostunica can consolidate his democratic government and make that transition , and the issue of punishing war criminals sort of takes a back seat .
Bass says US diplomats do n't want to risk destabilizing Serbia 's fragile political situation by pushing too hard for war crimes trials .
After all Bass points out , outside pressure has backfired in the past .
In Germany after World War I and in the Ottoman Empire also after World War I , the British and the French pushed really hard for war crimes trials , and the result in both countries was a kind of a nationalist backlash .
A nationalist backlash in Serbia right now could play into Milosevic 's hands , especially with parliamentary elections scheduled for next month .
That 's one reason Western governments are not demanding his immediate arrest , but critics of this approach say letting Milosevic stay in Belgrade could be equally destabilizing .
Eva Barnetts , professor of history at Yale , says President Kostunica should cooperate immediately with the Hague Tribunal .
This particular UN institution has in its power really to give instant legitimacy to Kostunica but of course at a price .
It means that the government of Yugoslavia has to become very serious about dealing with the indited war criminals , beginning with Slobodan Milosevic himself .
But even officials at The Hague say they are willing to be patient with the new Yugoslav President .
Tribunal spokesman Jim Landel says it helps that Kostunica 's people who initially refused to even entertain the idea of arresting Milosevic , may be starting to cooperate with the Tribunal .
They have already indicated that they are willing to allow the reopening of the prosecutor 's liaison office in Belgrade , and that 's certainly a welcome first step .
However , it is only a first step .
The Tribunal 's chief prosecutor Carla Del Ponte has applied for a Yugoslav visa and plans to visit Belgrade soon .
Delponte 's spokeswoman says the prosecutor has much to discuss with Kostunica , not least how to arrest all the indited war crimes suspects now in Serbia .
That wo n't be easy .
Even in Bosnia where Nato is in charge , troops have failed to capture Bosnian - Serb leader Radavan Karadzic , indited on genocide charges in connection with the 1995 massacre at Shrabanitca .
Yale history professor Eva Barnett says the excuses for not arresting Karadzic are not persuasive .
The claim is that this would engender tremendously destabilizing consequences that in any event it might be a very , very bloody affair and so on .
This does not seem terribly compelling to me .
I think that it has to be tried and of course there is always a danger that somebody might get hurt in this , but that is a danger that every attempt at remedying criminal activity has to face .
Hague prosecutor Carla Del Ponte is prepared to discuss arrest strategies with Kostunica including the use of foreign troops .
It 's difficult to know how he would react .
Kostunica has questioned the legality of the Hague Tribunal , and talked of trying Milosevic in Yugoslavia .
Still , Kostunica 's grace period wo n't last forever .
When the US Congress approved one hundred million dollars in aid to Serbia last month , it stipulated the aid would stop flowing if Belgrade has n't cooperated with the tribunal by March 31st .
For The World , I am Jeb Sharp .
Good evening .
That call to order you just heard reverberates through the Supreme Court every day that the justices convene , but today was no everyday session .
Never before has the United States Supreme Court taken up a case that could decide a presidential election .
It did today .
That session of the Supreme Court and two defeats for Al Gore in Florida courts dominate the news today .
We start with the U.S. Supreme Court , specifically at issue , an appeal from the campaign of George W. Bush that the Florida Supreme Court had exceeded its authority when it ruled Florida counties could have more time to hand - count ballots .
Throughout an hour and a half of argument , the justices were aggressive in peppering lawyers with questions , and they seemed interested on two issues .
Was there a federal issue involved that would even require the U.S. Supreme Court to rule ? and if so , did the Florida Supreme Court improperly rewrite Florida law , as Governor Bush contends ?
A sure sign of the historic nature of the day 's proceeding , for the first time ever , the court immediately released an audiotape of the arguments .
But in the courtroom , listening in person was ABC 's Jackie Judd .
Even now , hours after that hearing ended , there are still protesters circling the Supreme Court .
As boisterous as the protesters were , nothing intruded on the ritual inside .
The chief justice and the associate justices of the Supreme Court of the United States .
The courtroom was packed .
Al Gore 's top campaign aides , his children , Republican senators and congressmen , they were all there .
God save the United States and this honorable court .
First up , Ted Olson lawyer for George W. Bush , laying out the campaign 's main claim .
Olson made it through only 56 seconds of his arguments before a justice broke in .
Well , Mr. Olson --
Sandra Day O'Connor , often the swing vote on this court , demanded to know why the court even had a role in this case .
Olson argued that a century - old federal statute prevents laws governing an election from being created after the fact which , he claimed , is just what the Florida court did , and also , that the U.S. Constitution gives state legislatures , not the courts , the right to choose electors .
Of all the justices it was Ruth Bader Ginsburg who seemed most sympathetic to the Florida Supreme Court .
Midway through the hearing , Chief Justice Rehnquist seemed to scold his colleagues for being too talkative when he made an unusual offer to the lawyer representing Florida 's Attorney General .
And so it went on .
Laurence Tribe , Gore 's attorney , said the state court did nothing illegal .
It simply provided a way for a close election to be examined .
Justice O'Connor again , but this time suggesting the state court had overstepped its authority and perhaps there was a federal case here .
Justice Antonin Scalia also pressed Tribe .
He said the state court relied on the Florida Constitution to draft its decision , excluding state lawmakers and that violated the U.S. Constitution .
It was Justice Breyer who asked the most straightforward question of all .
What happens if the court rules in favor of Bush ?
The answer from the Secretary of State 's lawyer was , Bush wins and all the litigation in Florida ends .
Not everyone agrees .
They say that no matter which way the court rules , it will not provide nearly so much finality to this presidential election .
Charlie ?
Jackie Judd at the Supreme Court .
Our thanks .
The `` USS Cole '' has arrived back at the Mississippi shipyard where she was built .
ABC 's John M. Wethy reports tonight before the attack on the ship , the crew failed to take at least 25 % of the 80 different steps to protect the ship before landing in Yemen .
An investigation is already under way .
The ship 's captain is going to take a lot of heat for the 17 sailors who died .
The ship will sail again .
After George W. Bush is sworn in , Bill Clinton will head to New York .
The President has said he and his wife , now a New York senator will spend weekends at their house in Chappaqua .
Mr. Clinton will also spend time at his presidential library in Arkansas .
He says he will come to Washington , `` every now and then . ''
Today , U.S. Secretary of Defense William Cohen promised to catch and punish those responsible for the bombing of the `` Cole '' and defended the Navy 's decision to refuel ships in Yemen as investigators continued their day at work .
Morton Dean reports it 's a difficult day for the sailors remaining on board .
The stressful , monumental task for the crew on the U.S. carrier suffered a setback .
The ship began to take on water and lost electrical power again .
A difficult time became even more difficult .
It led to the cancellation of a memorial service planned for the 17 sailors who lost their lives .
Details are becoming known about the damage , most obvious , the huge hole , but also the deck is buckled .
Even the superstructure is damaged .
Hatches twisted out of shape and bulkheads destroyed .
Rear Admiral Mark Fitzgerald , who visited the Cole , was stunned by the damage .
I wo n't tell you whether the ship is going to sink or not sink , but there was considerable damage to the ship .
According to U.S. officials here tonight , the most important questions about the attack remain unanswered .
Any details or speculation on who specifically , we do n't know that at this point .
With well over 100 U.S. investigators now in Yemen , the search for evidence is now fully under way .
It 's been officially designated `` Operation Determined Response , '' and that suggests several things that the U.S. , of course , is determined to discover who carried out the bombing and that any group who helped plan the attack faces a response from the U.S. military .
The U.S. believes there are anti-American terror groups based in Yemen .
Half the population lives in settlements with 500 people or less , and senior U.S. officials here say the government , although friendly to the United States , does not have full control over the entire country .
Yemen 's President has repeatedly said an internal explosion rocked the `` USS Cole , '' but tomorrow U.S. officials expect him to announce that he has changed his mind , and tomorrow , the search for bodies will resume .
Ten U.S. sailors are still missing .
Morton Dean , Yemen .

The remains of four sailors killed in the `` USS Cole '' bombing returned to Dover Air Force Base in Delaware today .
They were the last of the dead to be flown home , but in Yemen , the search for those responsible for the bombing continues .
Investigators turned up new evidence and more leads today .
ABC 's John Miller reports .
Investigators have searched at least half a dozen homes around the port of Aden including this one , trying to retrace the movements of what they believe may be six or more suspects .
This house on Al Zaharah Street half a mile from the port is where investigators believe the bomb was built into the boat that carried it .
Just after the men moved in , neighbors say they erected a metal corrugated wall to block the neighbors ' view of the yard .
Investigators say the men who lived here worked on the boat behind these walls in the last few days of their stay almost constantly .
At first , neighbors were curious , but later they complained about the noise .
On the day of the bombing , neighbors saw the boat leaving through these gates pulled by a Nissan 4 x 4 truck .
The trip from the house to the harbor was only about a mile , then six miles by water to the spot where the American destroyer was refueling .
Today , FBI agents and divers were collecting evidence near the place they believe the boat was lowered into the water just before the attack on the `` USS Cole '' which killed 17 sailors and two suicide bombers .
Investigators have come up with a series of names of possible suspects found on papers in the houses and cars they searched .
In some cases , they have some names .
They have not been able to verify whether they 're accurate , true names .
In other cases , I do n't believe they have identities yet .
Yemeni sources say some of the bombers may have used ID cards issued by a government registration center 35 miles from Aden .
Today , at the walled - in headquarters of the government security agency , the manager of that center and several clerks who worked there were among dozens who have been detained and questioned .
Investigators are aware that a few weeks before the bombing , accused terrorist leader Osama Bin Laden released a videotape calling for holy war against Americans in the Gulf .
American investigators also say the way the bombers organized the plot in Aden has stark similarities to the way Bin Laden 's cells have operated in the past , but , they concede , while they are closer to learning the names of the bombers , they are still a long way from knowing or proving who sent them .
John Miller , ABC News , Aden .
We have an exclusive report tonight about the `` USS Cole , '' and an identical attack that was planned , but failed , several months earlier .
Here 's ABC 's John M Wethy .
ABC News has learned that the terrorists who attacked the `` USS Cole '' originally planned to hit a different American warship in the same port ten months earlier .
The attack was to be part of a worldwide effort during celebration of the millennium that included targets in Jordan and Seattle .
Intelligence sources say the target was to be a destroyer , the `` USS The Sullivans , '' which refueled in Yemen 's port of Aden in January .
Sources tell ABC News that a suspect who has been in custody for several weeks told Yemeni investigators that his group failed in their attack because their small boat , overloaded with explosives , sank just off the beach .
The suspect said it took months to repackage and redesign the load of high explosives that was eventually used against `` the Cole . ''

Investcorp , New York , said it and the management of Sports & Recreation Inc. bought the operator of the 10 - store Sports Unlimited chain for some $ 40 million .
The investment bank becomes majority shareholder in Sports & Recreation , a 10 - year - old sporting goods retailer , said Oliver E. Richardson , a member of Investcorp 's management committee and a director of the chain .
Sports Unlimited , Tampa , Fla. , posted revenue of $ 59 million for the year ended July 31 .
The company is `` very profitable '' on an operating basis , Mr. Richardson said , but he declined to specify numbers .
In 1982 , Sports & Recreation 's managers and certain passive investors purchased the company from Brunswick Corp. of Skokie , Ill .
In the latest transaction , management bought out the passive investors ' holding , Mr. Richardson said .
Hammond Co. , Newport Beach , Calif. , said Fidelity National Financial Inc. extended its previous agreement , under which it wo n't purchase any more of the mortgage banker 's common stock , through Oct. 31 .
The previous agreement expired Thursday .
Hammond said that its discussions with Fidelity , an Irvine , Calif. , title - insurance underwriter , are continuing , but that prospects for a longer - term standstill agreement are uncertain .
Fidelity has increased its stake in Hammond to 23.57 % in recent months .
Statements made in Securities and Exchange Commission filings led Hammond to request a standstill agreement .
Giant Group Ltd. said it terminated negotiations for the purchase of Aspen Airways , a Denver - based regional carrier that operates the United Express connector service under contract to UAL Corp. 's United Airlines .
Giant , a Beverly Hills , Calif. , collection of companies that is controlled by Hollywood producer Burt Sugarman , did n't give a reason for halting its plan to acquire the airline , and Aspen officials could n't be reached for comment .
Giant agreed last month to purchase the carrier .
Giant has n't ever disclosed the proposed price , although Avmark Inc. , an Arlington , Va. - based aircraft consulting concern , has valued Aspen 's fleet at about $ 46 million .
The airline would have become the latest in a peculiar blend of Giant companies , which are involved in making cement , recycling newsprint and operating fast - food restaurants .
The state - controlled insurer Assurances Generales de France said it has obtained regulatory approval to increase its stake in the financial holding company Cie. de Navigation Mixte above 10 % from the current level of about 8 % .
Friday 's approval was needed to conform with Bourse rules regarding companies with bank interests and follows a similar approval given Wednesday to Cie . Financiere de Paribas .
Both Paribas and AGF have been increasing their stakes in Navigation Mixte recently for what they have termed `` investment purposes , '' although the issue has been surrounded by takeover speculation in recent weeks .
AGF did n't comment officially on its reasons for seeking the approval , but people close to the group said it was done to make sure the group would have the flexibility to increase its stake in the future , should interesting price opportunities arise .
An AGF official did specify , however , that there was no foundation to recent rumors the group might be acting in concert with Paribas .
Lockheed Aeronautical Systems Co. , a unit of Lockheed Corp. , said it agreed to join with Aermacchi S.p . A. of Varese , Italy , to propose a new generation of jet trainers for the U.S. Air Force .
The Air Force is looking to buy 540 new primary jet trainers , with a total value of $ 1.5 billion to $ 2 billion , between 1994 and 2004 .
The aircraft would replace the T - 37 , made by the Cessna Aircraft Co. unit of General Dynamics Corp. , which the Air Force uses to train jet pilots .
Lockheed said the U.S. Navy may also buy an additional 340 trainer aircraft to replace its T34C trainers made by the Beech Aircraft Corp. unit of Raytheon Corp .
Under the agreement with Lockheed , Aermacchi will license Lockheed to build the Aermacchi MB - 339 jet tandem - trainer and will supply certain structures .
Lockheed will build additional structures and perform final assembly of the tandem - seat trainer at its Marietta , Ga. , plant should the Air Force order the craft .
A Lockheed spokesman in Burbank , Calif. , said he was n't aware of which other companies would be competing for the Air Force contract .
Striking auto workers ended their 19 - day occupation of a metal shop at a Peugeot S.A. factory in eastern France Friday as pay talks got under way in the capital .
But the Peugeot breakthrough came as a nationwide dispute by Finance Ministry employees disrupted border checkpoints and threatened the government 's ability to pay its bills .
The Peugeot metalworkers began filing out of the shop , which makes auto parts , at the plant in Mulhouse after voting 589 to 193 to abandon the occupation .
Their withdrawal was based on promises by Peugeot to open negotiations in Paris at the same time the last man left the premises .
The strike by customs officers , tax collectors , treasury workers and other civil servants attached to the Ministry of Finance may pose a more serious challenge to the government and the average Frenchman .
Ministry employees complain that they are poorly paid because of a complex job - rating system they say fails to take into account their education and level of technical expertise .
The market for $ 200 billion of high - risk junk bonds , battered by a succession of defaults and huge price declines this year , practically vanished Friday .
Trading ground to a halt as investors rushed to sell bonds , only to find themselves deserted by potential buyers .
Stunned , they watched brokerage houses mark down price quotations on their junk holdings while being able to execute very few actual trades .
`` The junk bond market is in a state of gridlock now -- there are no bids , only offers , '' says independent investor Martin D. Sass , who manages nearly $ 4 billion and who recently decided to buy distressed securities for a new fund .
This calamity is `` far from over , '' he says .
Junk 's collapse helped stoke the panicky selling of stocks that produced the deepest one - day dive in the Dow Jones Industrial Average since the Oct. 19 , 1987 , crash .
Simultaneously , it also helped trigger this year 's biggest rally in the U.S. government bond market as investors rushed to move capital into the highest - quality securities they could find .
But `` an eerie silence pervaded '' the junk market Friday as prices tumbled on hundreds of high - yield bonds despite `` no active trading , '' says John Lonski , an economist at Moody 's Investors Service Inc .
For example , the price of Southland Corp. 's $ 500 million of 16 3/4 % bonds due 2002 -- sold less than two years ago by Goldman , Sachs & Co. -- plummeted 25 % to just 30 cents on the dollar .
But not even Goldman would make a market in the securities of Southland , the owner of the nationwide chain of 7 - 11 convenience stores that is strapped for cash .
Goldman officials declined to comment .
Junk bonds , which mushroomed from less than $ 2 billion at the start of this decade , have been declining for months as issuer after issuer sank beneath the weight of hefty interest payments .
The shaky market received its biggest jolt last month from Campeau Corp. , which created its U.S. retailing empire with junk financing .
Campeau developed a cash squeeze that caused it to be tardy on some interest payments and to put its prestigious Bloomingdales department - store chain up for sale .
Now , dozens of corporations , including Ethan Allen , TW Services and York International , that are counting on at least $ 7 billion of scheduled new junk financings to keep their highly leveraged takeovers and buy - outs afloat , may never get the money .
`` The music has stopped playing , '' says Michael Harkins , a principal in the investment firm of Levy Harkins .
`` You 've either got a chair or you do n't . ''
In Friday 's aftermath , says R. Douglas Carleton , a director of high - yield finance at First Boston Corp. , `` much of the $ 7 billion forward calendar could be deferred , depending on the hysteria . ''
In August , First Boston withdrew a $ 475 million junk offering of Ohio Mattress bonds because potential buyers were `` very skittish . ''
The outlook `` looks shaky because we 're still waiting '' for mutual funds , in particular , to dump some of their junk bond holdings to pay off redemptions by individual investors , says King Penniman , senior vice president at McCarthy , Crisanti & Maffei , an investment arm of Xerox Financial Services .
Indeed , a Moody 's index that tracks the net asset values of 24 high - yield mutual funds declined for the 17th consecutive day Friday .
In a stark contrast , the benchmark 30 - year Treasury bond climbed more than 2 1/2 points , or about $ 25 for each $ 1,000 face amount , to 103 12/32 , its biggest gain of the year .
The bond 's yield dropped to 7.82 % , the lowest since March 31 , 1987 , according to Technical Data Global Markets Group .
The yield on three - month Treasury bills , considered the safest of all investments , plummeted about 0.7 percentage point to 7.16 % , the largest one - day decline since 1982 .
The main catalyst for government bond market rally was the 190.58 - point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average .
`` When you get panic in one market , you get flight to quality in the other , '' said Maria Ramirez , money market economist at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc .
Nevertheless , the problems of the junk market could prompt the Federal Reserve to ease credit in the months ahead .
`` This marks a significant shift in the interest rate outlook , '' says William Sullivan , director of money market research at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. , New York .
Any sustained credit - easing could be a lift for junk bonds as well as other securities .
Robert Dow , a partner and portfolio manager at Lord , Abbett & Co. , which manages $ 4 billion of high - yield bonds , says he does n't `` think there is any fundamental economic rationale -LCB- for the junk bond rout -RCB- .
It was herd instinct . ''
He adds : `` The junk market has witnessed some trouble and now some people think that if the equity market gets creamed that means the economy will be terrible and that 's bad for junk .
I do n't believe that 's the case , but I believe that people are running scared .
There is a flight to quality , and the quality is not in equities and not in junk -- it 's in Treasurys . ''
Even as trading in high - yield issues dried up over the past month , corporations sold more than $ 2 billion of new junk bonds .
For example , a recent $ 375 million offering of Petrolane Gas Services L.P. bonds sold by First Boston was three times oversubscribed .
A $ 550 million offering of Turner Broadcasting System Inc . high - yield securities sold last week by Drexel was increased $ 50 million because of strong demand .
First Boston estimates that in November and December alone , junk bond investors will receive $ 4.8 billion of coupon interest payments .
`` That 's a clear indication that there is and will be an undercurrent of basic business going on , '' says Mr. Carleton of First Boston .
`` I do n't know how people can say the junk bond market disappeared when there were $ 1.5 billion of orders for $ 550 million of junk bonds sold last week by Turner , '' says Raymond Minella , co-head of merchant banking at Merrill Lynch & Co .
`` When the rally comes , insurance companies will be leading it because they have billions to invest and invest they will .
There is plenty of money available from people who want to buy well - structured deals ; it 's the stuff that 's financed on a shoestring that people are wary of . ''
But such highly leveraged transactions seemed to have multiplied this year , casting a pall over much of the junk market .
Michael McNamara , director of fixed - income research at Kemper Financial Services , says the quality of junk issues has been getting poorer , contributing to the slide in prices .
`` Last year we probably bought one out of every three new deals , '' he says .
`` This year , at best , it 's in one in every five or six .
And our credit standards have n't changed one iota . ''
However , Mr. McNamara said the slide in junk is creating `` one hell of a buying opportunity '' for selective buyers .
For the moment , investors seem more preoccupied with the `` bad '' junk than the `` good '' junk .
`` The market has been weak since '' the announcement of the Campeau cash squeeze and the company 's subsequent bailout by Olympia & York , says Mr. Minella of Merrill Lynch .
`` That really affected the market in that people started to ask ` What else is in trouble ? ' ''
Well before Campeau , though , there were signs that the junk market was stumbling through one of its worst years ever .
Despite the relatively strong economy , junk bond prices did nothing except go down , hammered by a seemingly endless trail of bad news :
-- In June , two months before it would default on interest payments covering some of its $ 1.2 billion of speculative debt securities , New York - based Integrated Resources Inc. said it ran out of borrowed money .
-- In July , Southmark Corp. , the Dallas - based real estate and financial services company with about $ 1.3 billion of junk bonds , voluntarily filed for protection under U.S. bankruptcy law .
-- By the end of July , the difference in yield between an index of junk bonds and seven - year Treasury notes widened to more than 5.5 percentage points .
-- In August , Resorts International Inc. , which sold more than $ 500 million of junk bonds , suspended interest payments .
-- In September , just as the cash squeeze hit Campeau , Lomas Financial Corp. defaulted on $ 145 million of notes and appeared unlikely to pay interest on a total of $ 1.2 billion of debt securities .
Meantime , regulators are becoming increasingly worried as the rush to leverage shows no signs of abating .
Moody 's says the frequency of corporate credit downgrades is the highest this year since 1982 .
In addition , there are six times as many troubled banks as there were in the recession of 1981 , according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp .
`` The era of the 1980s is about compound interest and the reaching for it , '' says James Grant , editor of Grant 's Interest Rate Observer , an early critic of the junk bond market .
`` What we 've begun to see is the damage to businesses of paying exorbitant compound interest .
Businesses were borrowing at interest rates higher than their own earnings .
What we 're seeing now is the wrenching readjustment of asset values to a future when speculative - grade debt will be hard to obtain rather than easy . ''
Friday 's Market Activity
Prices of Treasury bonds surged in the biggest rally of the year as investors fled a plummeting stock market .
The benchmark 30 - year Treasury bond was quoted 6 p.m. EDT at 103 12/32 , compared with 100 27/32 Thursday , up 2 1/2 points .
The yield on the benchmark fell to 7.82 % , the lowest since March 31 , 1987 , according to Technical Data Global Markets Group .
The `` flight to quality '' began late in the day and followed a precipitous fall in the stock market .
Treasurys opened lower , reacting negatively to news that the producer price index -- a measure of inflation on the wholesale level -- accelerated in September .
Bond prices barely budged until midday .
Many bond market participants will be closely eying the action of the Federal Reserve , which might repeat its October 1987 injection of huge amounts of liquidity to buoy the financial markets and keep the economy from slowing into a recession .
Prices of municipals , investment - grade corporates and mortgage - backed bonds also rose , but lagged behind their Treasury counterparts .
Mortgage securities rose in hectic trading , with most of the activity concentrated in Government National Mortgage Association 9 % coupon securities , the most liquid mortgage issue .
The Ginnie Mae November 9 % issue ended at 98 25/32 , up 7/8 point on the day , to yield about 9.28 % to a 12 - year average life assumption .
Investment - grade corporate bonds were up about 1/2 to 3/4 point .
But the yield spread between lower - quality , investment - grade issues and higher - quality bonds widened .
And the yields on telephone and utility issues rose relative to other investment - grade bonds in anticipation of this week 's $ 3 billion bond offering by the Tennessee Valley Authority .
Despite rumors that the TVA 's long - awaited offering would be postponed because of the debacle in the equity markets , sources in the underwriting syndicate said they expect the issue will be priced as scheduled .
One of the sources said the smaller portions of $ 750 million each of five - year and 10 - year bonds have already been `` substantially oversubscribed . ''
Municipal bonds rose as much as 3/4 point .
Roger Lowenstein contributed to this article .
Friday 's 190 - point plunge in stocks does not come atop the climate of anxiety that dominated financial markets just prior to their 1987 October crash , and mechanisms have been put in place to keep markets more orderly .
Still , the lesson is about the same : On Friday the 13th , the market was spooked by Washington .
The consensus along the street seems to be that the plunge was triggered by the financing problems of the UAL takeover , and it 's certainly true the rout began immediately after the UAL trading halt .
Still , the consensus seems almost as wide that one faltering bid is no reason to write down the value of all U.S. business .
This observation leads us to another piece of news moving on the Dow Jones ticker shortly before the downturn : the success of Senate Democrats in stalling the capital gains tax cut .
The real value of all shares , after all , is directly impacted by the tax on any profits -LRB- all the more so given the limits on deductions for losses that show gains are not `` ordinary income '' -RRB- .
And market expectations clearly have been raised by the capital gains victory in the House last month .
An hour before Friday 's plunge , that provision was stripped from the tax bill , leaving it with $ 5.4 billion in tax increases without a capital gains cut .
There is a great deal to be said , to be sure , for stripping the garbage out of the reconciliation bill .
It would be a good thing if Congress started to decide issues one - by - one on their individual merits without trickery .
For one thing , no one doubts that the capital gains cut would pass on an up - or - down vote .
Since Senate leaders have so far fogged it up with procedural smokescreens , promises of a cleaner bill are suspect .
Especially so since President Bush has been weakened by the Panama fiasco .
To the extent that the UAL troubles contributed to the plunge , they are another instance of Washington 's sticky fingers .
As the best opportunities for corporate restructurings are exhausted of course , at some point the market will start to reject them .
But the airlines are scarcely a clear case , given anti-takeover mischief by Secretary of Transportation Skinner , who professes to believe safety will be compromised if KLM and British Airways own interests in companies that fly airplanes .
Worse , Congress has started to jump on the Skinner bandwagon .
James Oberstar , the Minnesota Democrat who chairs the Public Works and Transportation Committee 's aviation subcommittee , has put an anti-airline takeover bill on supersonic speed so that it would be passed in time to affect the American and United Air Lines bids .
It would give Mr. Skinner up to 50 days to `` review '' any bid for 15 % or more of the voting stock of any U.S. carrier with revenues of $ 1 billion or more .
So the UAL deal has problems , and the market loses 190 points .
Congratulations , Mr. Secretary and Mr. Congressman .
In the 1987 crash , remember , the market was shaken by a Danny Rostenkowski proposal to tax takeovers out of existance .
Even more important , in our view , was the Treasury 's threat to thrash the dollar .
The Treasury is doing the same thing today ; thankfully , the dollar is not under 1987 - style pressure .
Also , traders are in better shape today than in 1987 to survive selling binges .
They are better capitalized .
They are in less danger of losing liquidity simply because of tape lags and clearing and settlement delays .
The Fed promises any needed liquidity .
The Big Board 's liaison with the Chicago Board of Trade has improved ; it will be interesting to learn if `` circuit breakers '' prove to be a good idea .
In any event , some traders see stocks as underpriced today , unlike 1987 .
There is nothing wrong with the market that ca n't be cured by a little coherence and common sense in Washington .
But on the bearish side , that may be too much to expect .
First Chicago Corp. posted a third - quarter loss of $ 23.3 million after joining other big banks in further adding to its reserves for losses on foreign loans .
The parent company of First National Bank of Chicago , with $ 48 billion in assets , said it set aside $ 200 million to absorb losses on loans and investments in financially troubled countries .
The addition , on top of two big 1987 additions to foreign - loan reserves , brings the reserve to a level equaling 79 % of medium - term and long - term loans outstanding to troubled nations .
First Chicago since 1987 has reduced its loans to such nations to $ 1.7 billion from $ 3 billion .
Despite this loss , First Chicago said it does n't need to sell stock to raise capital .
During the quarter , the company realized a pretax gain of $ 60.4 million from the sale of its First Chicago Investment Advisors unit .
Combined foreign exchange and bond trading profits dipped 24 % against last year 's third quarter , to $ 38.2 million from $ 50.5 million .
Gains from First Chicago 's venture capital unit , a big leveraged buy - out investor , rose 32 % to $ 34 million from $ 25.7 million a year ago .
Interest income and most fee income was strong .
Greece 's second bout of general elections this year is slated for Nov. 5 .
For those hoping to see a modicum of political normalcy restored -- in view of Greece 's eight - year misadventure under autocratic pseudosocialism and subsequent three - month hitch with a conservative - communist coalition government -- there is but one bright sign : The scandals still encircling former Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou and his fallen socialist government are like flies buzzing around a rotting carcass .
In the mid-June round of voting , Greeks gave no clear mandate to any single political party .
The ad interim coalition government that emerged from post-electoral hagglings was , in essence , little more than the ill - conceived offspring of ideological miscegenation : On one side , the center - right New Democracy Party , headed by Constantine Mitsotakis .
On the other , the so - called Coalition of the Left and Progress -- a quaint and rather deceptive title for a merger of the pro-Soviet Communist Party of Greece and its Euro - Communist cousin , the Hellenic Left .
The unifying bond for this left - right mismatch was plain : PASOK -LRB- Mr. Papandreou 's party -RRB- as common political enemy .
The ostensible goal was a mop - up of government corruption , purportedly at all levels , but the main marks were Mr. Papandreou and his closest associates .
In point of fact , this catharsis was overdue by decades .
When reduced to buzzword status in ex parte pledges , however , the notion transmogrified into a promised assault , with targets primarily for political gains , not justice .
With regard to Greece 's long - bubbling bank - looting scandal , Mr. Papandreou 's principal accuser remains George Koskotas , former owner of the Bank of Crete and self - confessed embezzler , now residing in a jail cell in Salem , Mass. , from where he is fighting extradition proceedings that would return him to Greece .
Mr. Koskotas 's credibility is , at best , problematic .
He has ample motive to shift the blame , and his testimony has also been found less than forthright on numerous points .
Nevertheless , the New Democracy and Communist parties herald his assertions as proof of PASOK complicity .
Among unanswered questions are whether Mr. Papandreou received $ 23 million of stolen Bank of Crete funds and an additional $ 734,000 in bribes , as contended ; whether the prime minister ordered state agencies to deposit some $ 57 million in Mr. Koskotas 's bank and then skim off the interest ; and , what PASOK 's cut was from the $ 210 million Mr. Koskotas pinched .
Two former ministers were so heavily implicated in the Koskotas affair that PASOK members of Parliament voted to refer them to the special court .
But eluding parliamentary probe was the case of millions of drachmas Mr. Koskotas funneled into New Democracy coffers .
In the end , the investigation produced only circumstantial evidence and `` indications '' that point to PASOK , not clinching proof .
On another issue , Greeks were told how their national intelligence agency , the EYP , regularly monitored the telephone conversations of prominent figures , including key opposition politicians , journalists and PASOK cabinet members .
Despite convincing arguments , it was never established that Mr. Papandreou personally ordered or directed the wiretaps .
The central weakness of the `` scandals '' debates was pointed up especially well when discussions focused on arms deals and kickbacks .
The coalition government tried to show that PASOK ministers had received hefty sums for OKing the purchase of F - 16 Fighting Falcon and Mirage 2000 combat aircraft , produced by the U.S.based General Dynamics Corp. and France 's Avions Marcel Dassault , respectively .
Naturally , neither General Dynamics nor Dassault could be expected to hamper its prospective future dealings by making disclosures of sums paid -LRB- or not -RRB- to various Greek officials for services rendered .
So it seems that Mr. Mitsotakis and his communist chums may have unwittingly served Mr. Papandreou a moral victory on a platter : PASOK , whether guilty or not , can now traipse the countryside condemning the whole affair as a witch hunt at Mr. Papandreou 's expense .
But while verbal high jinks alone wo n't help PASOK regain power , Mr. Papandreou should never be underestimated .
First came his predictable fusillade : He charged the Coalition of the Left and Progress had sold out its leftist tenets by collaborating in a right - wing plot aimed at ousting PASOK and thwarting the course of socialism in Greece .
Then , to buttress his credibility with the left , he enticed some smaller leftist parties to stand for election under the PASOK banner .
Next , he continued to court the communists -- many of whom feel betrayed by the left - right coalition 's birth -- by bringing into PASOK a well - respected Communist Party candidate .
For balance , and in hopes of gaining some disaffected centrist votes , he managed to attract a former New Democracy Party representative and known political enemy of Mr. Mitsotakis .
Thus PASOK heads for the polls not only with diminished scandal - stench , but also with `` seals of approval '' from representatives of its harshest accusers .
Crucial as these elections are for Greece , pressing issues of state are getting lost in the shuffle .
The country 's future NATO participation remains unsure , for instance .
Greece also must revamp major pieces of legislation in preparation for the 1992 targets of heightened Common Market cooperation .
Greece 's bilateral relations with the U.S. need attention soon as well .
For one , the current accord concerning U.S. military bases in Greece lapses in May 1990 .
Negotiations for a new agreement were frozen before the June elections , but the clock is running .
Another matter of concern is the extradition of Mohammed Rashid , a Palestinian terrorist who is wanted in the U.S. for the 1982 bombing of a Pan American Airways flight .
The Greek courts have decided in favor of extradition in the Rashid case , but the matter awaits final approval from Greece 's next justice minister .
The Greeks seem barely aware of the importance of the case as a litmus test of whether Greece will be counted in or out for international efforts to combat terrorism .
That PASOK could win the elections outright is improbable ; the Greek press , previously eager to palm off PASOK 's line , has turned on Mr. Papandreou with a wild - eyed vengeance .
Yet the possibility of another lash - up government is all too real .
If Mr. Papandreou becomes the major opposition leader , he could hamstring a conservative - led coalition .
Also , he could force new elections early next year by frustrating the procedures for the election of the president of the republic in March .
New Democracy has once again glaringly underestimated the opponent and linked its own prospects to negative reaction against PASOK , forgetting to tend to either program clarity or the rectification of internal squabbles .
As for Mr. Papandreou ?
He 's not exactly sitting pretty at this stage .
But since he is undoubtedly one of the most proficient bull slingers who ever raked muck , it seems far wiser to view him as sidelined , but certainly not yet eliminated .

Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. of Japan and Siemens AG of West Germany announced they have completed a 100 million - mark -LRB- $ 52.2 million -RRB- joint venture to produce electronics parts .
In the venture 's first fiscal year , Siemens will hold 74.9 % of the venture and a Matsushita subsidiary , Matsushita Electronic Components Co. , 25.1 % .
A basic agreement between the two companies was announced in June .
The new company is to be called Siemens Matsushita Components G.m.b . H .
It will have its headquarters in Munich .
Matsushita 's share in the venture will rise to 35 % Oct. 1 , 1990 , and to 50 % the following Oct. 1 .
Siemens will retain majority voting rights .
The parent companies forecast sales for the venture of around 750 million marks for its first fiscal year , Matsushita said .
Sales are expected to rise to one billion marks after four years .
The company will have production facilities in West Germany , Austria , France and Spain .
Roger Rosenblatt , editor of U.S. News & World Report , resigned Friday from the weekly news magazine .
Mr. Rosenblatt said he resigned because of difficulties with commuting between his home in New York and the magazine 's editorial offices in Washington .
`` Frankly , I missed my family , '' said Mr. Rosenblatt .
In Mr. Rosenblatt 's tenure , the magazine 's advertising pages and circulation have grown significantly .
But at 2.3 million weekly paid circulation , U.S. News still ranks third behind Time Warner Inc. 's Time magazine , with 4.4 million circulation , and Washington Post Co. 's Newsweek , with 3.3 million circulation .
Mortimer B. Zuckerman , chairman and editor in chief , said Mr. Rosenblatt would be succeeded starting today by Michael Ruby , the magazine 's executive editor , and Merrill McLoughlin , a senior writer .
Mr. Ruby and Ms. McLoughlin are married to each other .
Mr. Zuckerman said his magazine would maintain its editorial format , which is a mix of analysis and trend stories with service - oriented , how - to articles .
Mr. Rosenblatt , a senior writer at Time magazine before joining U.S. News & World Report , said he had numerous job offers from other magazines while he was editor .
The offers were to work as a writer , not an editor .
He said he will now consider those offers .
Avions Marcel Dassault - Breguet Aviation S.A. said group profit before taxes and contributions to employee profit - sharing soared 97 % to 839 million francs -LRB- $ 129.6 million -RRB- in the first half of 1989 from 425 million francs a year earlier .
The French aircraft group pointed out , however , that financial results from its sector of industry are frequently erratic because of irregular cash flow from large contracts .
It noted , for example , that group revenue for the first half was 8.734 billion francs , down about 12 % from 9.934 billion francs a year earlier .
Still , it said it expects sales for all of 1989 to be on the order of 20 billion francs , reflecting anticipated billings for two large contracts in the second half of the year .
For all of 1988 , Dassault had group profit of 428 million francs on revenue of 18.819 billion francs .
The group has n't yet released earnings figures for the first half of 1989 , nor has it made a detailed forecast of its full - year earnings .
Freeport - McMoRan Inc. said a temporary cessation of operations at its Sunshine Bridge uranium - recovery facility in Donaldsonville , La. , will result in slight earnings improvement to both the company and its Freeport - McMoRan Resource Partners Limited Partnership unit .
The company did n't elaborate .
The diversified energy and minerals concern said that a depressed uranium market is responsible for the temporary mothballing of the plant , but that the plant can be reactivated quickly when the market improves .
More than 400,000 pounds of uranium a year have been produced at the facility during the past seven years .
A second uranium - recovery plant at Uncle Sam , La. , that produces more than 700,000 pounds of uranium annually , will continue to operate .
Freeport - McMoRan said the shutdown wo n't affect sales volumes under long - term sales contracts of its Freeport Uranium Recovery Co. unit , but will reduce the amount of product sold on the spot market .
Freeport - McMoRan Resource Partners , as owner of the uranium - recovery technology , receives royalty payments .
Business Week subscribers may hear this week 's issue talking back to them .
A four - page ad from Texas Instruments Inc. , running in approximately 140,000 issues of the Oct. 20 `` Corporate Elite '' issue of the McGraw - Hill Inc. publication , contains a speech synthesizer laminated between two of the pages .
Readers who pull off a piece of tape and press a switch will hear a tiny -- but distinctly human - sounding -- voice announce , `` I am the talking chip , '' as it launches into a 15 - second discourse on its own attributes .
The talking chip is n't cheap -- the per - ad cost to Texas Instruments is about $ 4 , and that 's without adding in Business Week 's charge -- but Texas Instruments believes it is a first .
Previous efforts have included musical ads , featuring simple tone - generating chips that play a tune , but the voice synthesizer in this effort is much more sophisticated , with none of the robotic flatness that one hears , for example , when calling telephone directory services .
And for those who miss the message the first time around , not to worry : Three tiny batteries provide enough juice for as many as 650 replays .
Lomas Financial Corp. , Dallas , said it will ask a U.S. bankruptcy court to allow it to hire Lazard Freres & Co. to help it sell its leasing unit .
Lomas , assisted by Merrill Lynch Capital Markets , has been trying to sell its Equitable Lomas Leasing Co. for several months , apparently without success .
The real estate and mortgage banking concern had hoped to use proceeds from the sale to reduce its debt .
Without cash from asset sales and unable to reach a new bank - credit agreement , Lomas defaulted on $ 145 million in notes that became due Sept. 1 .
It filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code Sept. 24 to give it additional time to work on a plan to restructure its $ 1.45 billion in senior debt .
Lomas said Merrill Lynch , which owns bonds and equity in Lomas , could n't continue as Lomas 's investment banker because it is also a creditor .
It said it chose Lazard in part because of Lazard 's offices in Europe and Japan , where investors might be interested in a U.S. leasing company .
Of all the one - time expenses incurred by a corporation or professional firm , few are larger or longer term than the purchase of real estate or the signing of a commercial lease .
To take full advantage of the financial opportunities in this commitment , however , the corporation or professional firm must do more than negotiate the best purchase price or lease terms .
It must also evaluate the real - estate market in the chosen location from a new perspective .
Specifically , it must understand how real - estate markets overreact to shifts in regional economies and then take advantage of these opportunities .
When a regional economy catches cold , the local real - estate market gets pneumonia .
In other words , real - estate market indicators , such as building permits and leasing activity , plummet much further than a local economy in recession .
This was seen in the late 1960s in Los Angeles and the mid-1970s in New York .
But the reverse is also true : When a region 's economy rebounds from a slowdown , these real - estate indicators will rebound far faster than the improving economy .
Why do local real - estate markets overreact to regional economic cycles ?
Because real - estate purchases and leases are such major long - term commitments that most companies and individuals make these decisions only when confident of future economic stability and growth .
Metropolitan Detroit was written off economically during the early 1980s , as the domestic auto industry suffered a serious sales depression and adjustment .
Area employment dropped by 13 % from its 1979 peak and retail sales were down 14 % .
However , the real - estate market was hurt even more .
For example , residential building permits in the trough year of 1982 were off 76 % from the 1979 peak level .
Once metropolitan Detroit 's economy rallied in the mid-1980s , real estate rebounded .
Building permits , for example , soared a staggering 400 % between 1982 and the peak year of 1986 .
Where , savvy corporations and professional firms are now asking , are today 's opportunities ?
Look no further than metropolitan Houston and Denver , two of the most depressed , overbuilt and potentially undervalued real - estate markets in the nation .
Of course , some observers have touted Houston and Denver for the past five years as a counter-cyclical play .
But now appears to be the time to act .
Metropolitan Houston 's economy did drop and then flatten in the years after its 1982 peak .
In the mid-1980s , employment was down as much as 5 % from the 1982 peak and retail sales were off 13 % .
The real - estate market suffered even more severe setbacks .
Office construction dropped 97 % .
The vacancy rate soared more than 20 % in nearly every product category , and more than 30 % of office space was vacant .
To some observers , the empty office buildings of Houston 's `` see - through skyline '' were indicative of a very troubled economy .
As usual , the real - estate market had overreacted .
Actually , the region 's economy retained a firm foundation .
Metropolitan Houston 's population has held steady over the past six years .
And personal income , after slumping in the mid-1980s , has returned to its 1982 level in real dollar terms .
Today , metropolitan Houston 's real - estate market is poised for a significant turnaround .
More than 42,000 jobs were added in metro Houston last year , primarily in biotechnology , petrochemical processing , and the computer industry .
This growth puts Houston in the top five metro areas in the nation last year .
And forecasts project a 2.5 % to 3 % growth rate in jobs over the next few years -- nearly twice the national average .
Denver is another metropolitan area where the commercial real - estate market has overreacted to the region 's economic trends , although Denver has not experienced as severe an economic downturn as Houston .
By some measures , metropolitan Denver 's economy has actually improved in the past four years .
Its population has continued to increase since 1983 , the peak year of the economic cycle .
Employment is now 4 % higher than in 1983 .
Buying income in real dollars actually increased 15 % between 1983 and 1987 -LRB- the most recent year available -RRB- .
The rates of increase , however , are less than the rapid growth of the boom years , and this has resulted in a loss of confidence in the economy .
In a self - fulfilling prophecy , therefore , the region 's real - estate market all but collapsed in recent years .
Housing building permits are down more than 75 % from their 1983 peaks .
Although no one can predict when metropolitan Denver 's real - estate market will rebound , major public works projects costing several billion dollars are under way or planned -- such as a new convention center , a major beltway encircling the metropolitan area , and a new regional airport .
When Denver 's regional economy begins to grow faster -- such a recovery could occur as early as next year -- business and consumer confidence will return , and the resulting explosion of real - estate activity will dwarf the general economic rebound .
What real - estate strategy should one follow in a metropolitan area whose economic health is not as easy to determine as Houston 's or Denver 's ?
Generally , overcapacity in commercial real estate is dropping from its mid-1980s peak , even in such economically healthy metropolitan areas as Washington , New York and Los Angeles .
Vacancy rates in the 15 % to 19 % range today may easily rise to the low to mid-20 % range in a couple of years .
Under these conditions , even a flattening out of economic growth -- `` catching cold '' -- in the healthy metropolitan areas will create significant opportunities for corporations and professional service firms looking for bargains as the realestate industry catches pneumonia .
Those looking for real - estate bargains in distressed metropolitan areas should lock in leases or buy now ; those looking in healthy metropolitan areas should take a short - term -LRB- three - year -RRB- lease and wait for the bargains ahead .
Mr. Leinberger is managing partner of a real - estate advisory firm based in Beverly Hills , Calif .
Kysor Industrial Corp. said it expects its third - quarter net earnings to be between two cents and four cents a share , compared with 61 cents a share a year ago .
Analysts had been projecting that the company 's earnings would be between 25 cents and 30 cents a share .
The year - earlier third - quarter earnings amounted to $ 4.1 million .
The company said a drop in activity in the powerboat industry reduced sales volume at its two marine - related operations .
Also , the company said its commercial products operation failed to meet forecasts .
Kysor , a maker of heavy - duty truck and commercial refrigeration equipment , said it expects its fourth - quarter earnings to be more closely in line with usual levels , which are between 30 cents and 50 cents a share .
Common Cause asked both the Senate Ethics Committee and the Justice Department to investigate $ 1 million in political gifts by Arizona businessman Charles Keating to five U.S. senators who interceded with thrift - industry regulators for him .
Mr. Keating is currently the subject of a $ 1.1 billion federal anti-racketeering lawsuit accusing him of bleeding off assets of a California thrift he controlled , Lincoln Savings & Loan Association , and driving it into insolvency .
Fred Wertheimer -- president of Common Cause , the self - styled citizens lobby -- said Mr. Keating already has conceded attempting to buy influence with the lawmakers -- Democratic Sens. Dennis DeConcini of Arizona , Alan Cranston of California , John Glenn of Ohio and Donald Riegle of Michigan ; and GOP Sen. John McCain of Arizona .
Mr. Wertheimer based this on a statement by Mr. Keating that was quoted in a Wall Street Journal story in April : `` One question ... had to do with whether my financial support in any way influenced several political figures to take up my cause .
I want to say in the most forceful way I can : I certainly hope so . ''
In a highly unusual meeting in Sen. DeConcini 's office in April 1987 , the five senators asked federal regulators to ease up on Lincoln .
According to notes taken by one of the participants at the meeting , the regulators said Lincoln was gambling dangerously with depositors ' federally insured money and was `` a ticking time bomb . ''
Mr. Keating had complained that the regulators were being too zealous .
The notes show that Sen. DeConcini called the Federal Home Loan Bank Board 's regulations `` grossly unfair , '' and that Sen. Glenn insisted that Mr. Keating 's thrift was `` viable and profitable . ''
For the next two years , the Bank Board , which at the time was the agency responsible for regulating thrifts , failed to act -- even after federal auditors warned in May 1987 that Mr. Keating had caused Lincoln to become insolvent .
Lincoln 's parent company , American Continental Corp. , entered bankruptcy - law proceedings this April 13 , and regulators seized the thrift the next day .
The newly formed Resolution Trust Corp. , successor to the Bank Board , filed suit against Mr. Keating and several others on Sept. 15 .
Mr. Keating has filed his own suit , alleging that his property was taken illegally .
The cost to taxpayers of Lincoln 's collapse has been estimated at as much as $ 2.5 billion .
Details of the affair have become public gradually over the past two years , mostly as a result of reporting by several newspapers .
In the midst of his 1988 re-election campaign , Sen. Riegle , chairman of the Senate Banking Committee , returned $ 76,000 in contributions after a Detroit newspaper said that Mr. Keating had gathered the money for him about two weeks before the meeting with regulators .
Sen. DeConcini , after months of fending off intense press criticism , returned $ 48,000 only last month , shortly after the government formally accused Mr. Keating of defrauding Lincoln .
In addition , Sen. McCain last week disclosed that he belatedly had paid $ 13,433 to American Continental as reimbursement for trips he and his family took aboard the corporate jet to Mr. Keating 's vacation home at Cat Cay , the Bahamas , from 1984 through 1986 .
Sen. McCain said he had meant to pay for the trips at the time but that the matter `` fell between the cracks . ''
Mr. Keating , his family members and associates also donated $ 112,000 to Sen. McCain 's congressional campaigns over the years , according to press accounts .
But Sen. McCain says Mr. Keating broke off their friendship abruptly in 1987 , because the senator refused to press the thrift executive 's case as vigorously as Mr. Keating wanted .
`` He became very angry at that , left my office and told a number of people that I was a wimp , '' Sen. McCain recalls .
In July , California newspapers disclosed that Mr. Keating gave $ 850,000 in corporate funds to three tax - exempt voter registration organizations in 1987 and 1988 at the behest of Sen. Cranston , who conceded that soliciting the money was `` a pretty stupid thing to do politically . ''
In addition , Sen. Cranston received $ 47,000 in campaign donations through Mr. Keating , and the California Democratic party received $ 85,000 in corporate donations for a 1986 get - out - the - vote drive that benefited the senator 's re-election campaign that year .
Also in July , Ohio newspapers disclosed $ 200,000 in corporate donations by Mr. Keating to the National Council on Public Policy , a political committee controlled by Sen. Glenn .
That was in addition to $ 34,000 in direct campaign donations arranged by Mr. Keating to the Ohio senator .
Mr. Wertheimer said the Senate Ethics Committee should hire a special outside counsel to conduct an investigation , as was done in the case of former House Speaker James Wright .
Wilson Abney , staff director of the ethics panel , would n't comment .
Sen. Riegle said he would cooperate with any inquiry , but that his conduct had been `` entirely proper . ''
Sen. McCain said he had been `` deeply concerned '' at the time of the meeting that it might seem to be improper , but decided it was `` entirely appropriate '' for him to seek fair treatment for a constituent .
Sen. Glenn said he had already made a complete disclosure of his role in the affair and `` I am completely satisfied to let this matter rest in the hands of the Senate Ethics Committee . ''
Sen. DeConcini said , `` When all is said and done , I expect to be fully exonerated . ''
Sen. Cranston , who had already volunteered his help to the Federal Bureau of Investigation in any investigation of Mr. Keating , portrayed his role in 1987 as prodding regulators to act .
`` Why did n't the Bank Board act sooner ? '' he said .
`` That is what Common Cause should ask be investigated .
Trinity Industries Inc. said it reached a preliminary agreement to manufacture 1,000 coal rail cars for Norfolk Southern Corp .
Trinity estimated the value of the pact at more than $ 40 million .
Trinity said it plans to begin delivery of the rail cars in the first quarter of 1990 .
It said the 1,000 rail cars are in addition to the 1,450 coal rail cars presently being produced for Norfolk Southern , a Norfolk , Va. - based railroad concern .
When China opened its doors to foreign investors in 1979 , toy makers from Hong Kong were among the first to march in .
Today , with about 75 % of the companies ' products being made in China , the chairman of the Hong Kong Toys Council , Dennis Ting , has suggested a new sourcing label : `` Made in China by Hong Kong Companies . ''
The toy makers were pushed across the border by rising labor and land costs in the British colony .
But in the wake of the shootings in Beijing on June 4 , the Hong Kong toy industry is worrying about its strong dependence on China .
Although the manufacturers stress that production has n't been affected by China 's political turmoil , they are looking for additional sites .
The toy makers , and their foreign buyers , cite uncertainty about China 's economic and political policies .
`` Nobody wants to have all his eggs in one basket , '' says David Yeh , chairman and chief executive officer of International Matchbox Group Ltd .
Indeed , Matchbox and other leading Hong Kong toy makers were setting up factories in Southeast Asia , especially in Thailand , long before the massacre .
Their steps were partly prompted by concern over a deterioration of business conditions in southern China .
By diversifying supply sources , the toy makers do n't intend to withdraw from China , manufacturers and foreign buyers say .
It would n't be easy to duplicate quickly the manufacturing capacity built up in southern China during the past decade .
A supply of cheap labor and the access to Hong Kong 's port , airport , banks and support industries , such as printing companies , have made China 's Guangdong province a premier manufacturing site .
`` South China is the most competitive source of toys in the world , '' says Henry Hu , executive director of Wah Shing Toys Consolidated Ltd .
Hong Kong trade figures illustrate the toy makers ' reliance on factories across the border .
In 1988 , exports of domestically produced toys and games fell 19 % from 1987 , to HK$ 10.05 billion -LRB- US$ 1.29 billion -RRB- .
But re-exports , mainly from China , jumped 75 % , to HK$ 15.92 billion .
In 1989 's first seven months , domestic exports fell 29 % , to HK$ 3.87 billion , while re-exports rose 56 % , to HK$ 11.28 billion .
Manufacturers say there is no immediate substitute for southern China , where an estimated 120,000 people are employed by the toy industry .
`` For the next few years , like it or not , China is going to be the main supplier , '' says Edmund Young , vice president of Perfecta Enterprises Ltd. , one of the first big Hong Kong toy makers to move across the border .
In the meantime , as manufacturers and buyers seek new sites , they are focusing mainly on Southeast Asia .
Several big companies have established manufacturing joint ventures in Thailand , including Matchbox , Wah Shing and Kader Industrial Co. , the toy manufacturer headed by Mr. Ting .
Malaysia , the Philippines and Indonesia also are being studied .
With the European Community set to remove its internal trade barriers in 1992 , several Hong Kong companies are beginning to consider Spain , Portugal and Greece as possible manufacturing sites .
Worries about China came just as Hong Kong 's toy industry was recovering from a 1987 sales slump and bankruptcy filings by two major U.S. companies , Worlds of Wonder Inc. and Coleco Industries Inc .
Hong Kong manufacturers say large debt writeoffs and other financial problems resulting from the 1987 difficulties chastened the local industry , causing it to tighten credit policies and financial management .
The industry regards last year and this year as a period of recovery that will lead to improved results .
Still , they long for a `` mega-hit '' toy to excite retail sales in the U.S. , Hong Kong 's biggest market for toys and games .
The closest thing the colony 's companies have to a U.S. mega-hit this year is the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles series of action figures manufactured by Playmates Holdings Ltd .
Introduced in mid-1988 , the 15 - centimeter - tall plastic turtles are based on an American comic book and television series .
Paul Kwan , managing director of Playmates , says 10 million Ninja Turtles have been sold , placing the reptilian warriors among the 10 biggest - selling toys in the U.S. .
Should sales continue to be strong through the Christmas season , which accounts for about 60 % of U.S. retail toy sales , Mr. Kwan said the Ninja Turtles could make 1989 a record sales year for Playmates .
Other Hong Kong manufacturers expect their results to improve only slightly this year from 1988 .
Besides the lack of a fast - selling product , they cite the continued dominance of the U.S. market by Nintendo Entertainment System , an expensive video game made by Nintendo Co. of Japan .
Nintendo buyers have little money left to spend on other products .
Many of the toy makers ' problems started well before June 4 as a result of overstrained infrastructure and Beijing 's austerity programs launched late last year .
Toy makers complain that electricity in Guangdong has been provided only three days a week in recent months , down from five days a week , as the province 's rapid industrialization has outstripped its generating capacity .
Manufacturers are upgrading standby power plants .
Bank credit for China investments all but dried up following June 4 .
Also , concern exists that the harder - line Beijing leadership will tighten its control of Guangdong , which has been the main laboratory for the open - door policy and economic reforms .
But , toy manufacturers and other industrialists say Beijing will be restrained from tightening controls on export - oriented southern China .
They say China 's trade deficit is widening and the country is too short of foreign exchange for it to hamper production in Guangdong .
`` The Chinese leaders have to decide whether they want control or whether the want exports , '' says Mr. Kwan of Playmates .
The Bush administration , urging the Supreme Court to give states more leeway to restrict abortions , said minors have n't any right to abortion without the consent of their parents .
Solicitor General Kenneth Starr argued that the 1973 Supreme Court decision , Roe vs. Wade , recognizing a constitutional right to abortion , was incorrect .
He also argued that the high court was wrong in 1976 to rule that minors have a right to abortion that ca n't be absolutely vetoed by their parents .
The administration 's position was outlined in a friend - of - the - court brief filed in one of three abortion cases the Supreme Court will hear argued and will decide this term .
The administration filed the brief in an appeal involving a Minnesota law that requires that both parents of a minor be notified before she may have an abortion .
The administration urged the justices to adopt a legal standard suggested by Chief Justice William Rehnquist last July when the high court upheld Missouri 's abortion restrictions .
Under that standard , which garnered the votes of only three of the nine justices , a state restriction of abortion is constitutional if the state has a `` reasonable '' justification for adopting it .
That is a much easier standard for a state to satisfy than the Supreme Court 's test since 1973 , which requires a state to have a `` compelling '' reason for restricting abortion .
On the provisions of the Minnesota law , the Bush administration said that requiring that both parents be notified is a reasonable regulation , and that there is no need to have an alternative that allows minors to go to court for a judge 's permission instead .
The case , Hodgson vs. Minnesota , will be argued Nov. 29 .
For 20 years , federal rules have barred the three major television networks from sharing in one of the most lucrative and fastest - growing parts of the television business .
And for six years , NBC , ABC and CBS have negotiated with Hollywood studios in a futile attempt to change that .
But with foreign companies snapping up U.S. movie studios , the networks are pressing their fight harder than ever .
They hope the foreign deals will divide the Hollywood opposition and prod Congress to push for ending federal rules that prohibit the networks from grabbing a piece of rerun sales and owning part of the shows they put on the air .
Even network executives , however , admit privately that victory -- either in Congress or in talks with the studios -- is highly doubtful any time soon .
And so the networks also are pushing for new ways to sidestep the `` fin - syn '' provisions , known formally as the Financial Interest and Syndication Rules .
That became clear last week with the disclosure that National Broadcasting Co. , backed by the deep pockets of parent General Electric Co. , had tried to help fund Qintex Australia Ltd. 's now - scuttled $ 1.5 billion bid for MGM / UA Communications Co .
NBC 's interest may revive the deal , which MGM / UA killed last week when the Australian concern had trouble raising cash .
Even if that deal is n't revived , NBC hopes to find another .
`` Our doors are open , '' an NBC spokesman says .
NBC may yet find a way to take a passive , minority interest in a program - maker without violating the rules .
And any NBC effort could prompt CBS Inc. and ABC 's parent , Capital Cities / ABC Inc. , to look for ways of skirting the fin - syn regulations .
But the networks ' push may only aggravate an increasingly bitter rift between them and Hollywood studios .
Both sides are to sit down next month for yet another meeting on how they might agree on reducing fin - syn restraints .
Few people privy to the talks expect the studios to budge .
The networks still are `` uninhibited in their authority '' over what shows get on the air , charges Motion Picture Association President Jack Valenti , the most vociferous opponent of rescinding the rules .
Studios are `` powerless '' to get shows in prime - time lineups and keep them there long enough to go into lucrative rerun sales , he contends .
And that 's why the rules , for the most part , must stay in place , he says .
Studio executives in on the talks - including officials at Paramount Communications Inc. , Fries Entertainment Inc. , Warner Communications Inc. and MCA Inc. -- declined to be interviewed .
But Mr. Valenti , who represents the studios , asserts : `` The whole production industry , to a man , is on the side of preserving '' the rules .
Such proclamations leave network officials all the more doubtful that the studios will bend .
`` They do n't seem to have an incentive to negotiate , '' says one network executive .
`` And there 's no indication that Washington is prepared to address the rules .
That 's the problem , is n't it ? ''
Indeed it is .
Congress has said repeatedly it wants no part of the mess , urging the studios and the networks , which license rights to air shows made by the studios , to work out their own compromise .
But recent developments have made the networks -- and NBC President Robert Wright , in particular -- ever more adamant that the networks must be unshackled to survive .
The latest provocation : Sony Corp. 's plan to acquire Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc. for $ 3.4 billion , and to buy independent producer Guber Peters Entertainment Co. for $ 200 million .
`` I wonder what Walter Cronkite will think of the Sony / Columbia Broadcast System Trinitron Evening News with Dan Rather broadcast exclusively from Tokyo , '' wrote J.B. Holston , an NBC vice president , in a commentary in last week 's issue of Broadcasting magazine .
In his article , Mr. Holston , who was in Europe last week and unavailable , complained that the `` archaic restraints '' in fin - syn rules have `` contributed directly to the acquisition of the studios by non-U.S. enterprises .
'' -LRB- He did n't mention that NBC , in the meantime , was hoping to assist Australia 's Qintex in buying
An NBC spokesman counters that Mr. Holston 's lament was `` entirely consistent '' with NBC plans because the U.S. rules would limit NBC 's involvement in the Qintex deal so severely as to be `` light years away from the type of unrestrained deals available to Sony -- and everyone else except the three networks . ''
The Big Three 's drumbeat for deregulation began intensifying in the summer when the former Time Inc. went ahead with plans to acquire Warner .
Although Time already had a long - term contract to buy movies from Warner , the merger will let Time 's largely unregulated pay - cable channel , Home Box Office , own the Warner movies aired on HBO -- a vertical integration that is effectively blocked by fin - syn regulations .
NBC 's Mr. Wright led the way in decrying the networks ' inability to match a Time - Warner combination .
He spoke up again when the Sony bid for Columbia was announced .
Since NBC 's interest in the Qintex bid for MGM / UA was disclosed , Mr. Wright has n't been available for comment .
With a Qintex deal , NBC would move into uncharted territory -- possibly raising hackles at the studios and in Washington .
`` It 's never really been tested , '' says William Lilley III , who as a top CBS executive spent years lobbying to have the rules lifted .
He now runs Policy Communications in Washington , consulting to media companies .
Fin - syn rules do n't explicitly block a network from buying a passive , small stake in a company that profits from the rerun syndication networks ca n't enjoy .
Hence , NBC might be able to take , say , a 5 % stake in a company such as MGM / UA .
If the transaction raised objections , the studio 's syndication operations could be spun off into a separate firm in which the network does n't have a direct stake .
But such convolutions would still block the networks from grabbing a big chunk of the riches of syndication .
Under current rules , even when a network fares well with a 100 % - owned series -- ABC , for example , made a killing in broadcasting its popular crime / comedy `` Moonlighting '' -- it is n't allowed to share in the continuing proceeds when the reruns are sold to local stations .
Instead , ABC will have to sell off the rights for a one - time fee .
The networks admit that the chances of getting the relief they want are slim -- for several years at the least .
Six years ago they were tantalizingly close .
The Reagan - era Federal Communications Commission had ruled in favor of killing most of the rules .
Various evidence , including a Brookings Institution study of some 800 series that the networks had aired and had partly owned in the 1960s , showed the networks did n't wield undue control over the studios as had been alleged .
But just eight days before the rules were to die , former President Ronald Reagan , a one - time actor , intervened on behalf of Hollywood .
The FCC effort collapsed .
The networks and studios have bickered ever since .
Network officials involved in the studio talks may hope the foreign influx builds more support in Washington , but that seems unlikely .
In Congress , the issue falters : It 's about money , not program quality , and Hollywood has lots of clout given its fund raising for senators and representatives overseeing the issue .
A spokesman for Rep. Edward J. Markey -LRB- D - Mass. -RRB- , who heads a subcommittee that oversees the FCC , says Mr. Markey feels `` the world has been forever changed by the Sony - Columbia deal . ''
But he said Mr. Markey hopes this pushes the networks and studios to work it out on their own .
And at the FCC , meanwhile , new Chairman Alfred C. Sikes has said he wants the two sides to hammer out their own plan .
Recognition Equipment Inc. said it settled a civil action filed against it by the federal government on behalf of the U.S. Postal Service .
The government sued the company in April , seeking $ 23,000 and other unspecified damages related to an alleged contract - steering scheme .
The suit named the company , former chief executive officer William G. Moore Jr. , former vice president Robert W. Reedy and five defendants who were n't part of the company .
The suit charged the defendants with causing Peter E. Voss , an ex-member of the Postal Service board of governors , to accept $ 23,000 in bribes , kickbacks and gratuities .
Mr. Voss was previously sentenced to four years in prison and fined $ 11,000 for his role in the scheme .
In the agreement , Recognition agreed to pay the government $ 20,000 in return for the release of all claims against the company , Mr. Moore and Mr. Reedy .
The five additional defendants were n't parties to the settlement .
A trial on criminal allegations against the company and the same two former executives began Sept. 27 in federal court for the District of Columbia .
They were indicted last October on charges of fraud , theft and conspiracy related to an effort to win $ 400 million in Postal Service equipment contracts by the maker of data management equipment .
The company and its executives deny the charges .
In a related development , Recognition Equipment said the Postal Service has barred the company from bidding on postal contracts for an additional 120 days .
The Postal Service originally suspended the company Oct. 7 , 1988 , and has been renewing the ban ever since .
The company said it will continue to pursue a lifting of the suspension .
Walter Sisulu and the African National Congress came home yesterday .
After 26 years in prison , Mr. Sisulu , the 77 - year - old former secretary - general of the liberation movement , was dropped off at his house by a prison services ' van just as the sun was coming up .
At the same time , six ANC colleagues , five of whom were arrested with him in 1963 and sentenced to life imprisonment , were reunited with their families at various places around the country .
And as the graying men returned to their homes , the ANC , outlawed in South Africa since 1960 and still considered to be the chief public enemy by the white government , defiantly returned to the streets of the country 's black townships .
A huge ANC flag , with black , green and gold stripes , was hoisted over the rickety gate at Mr. Sisulu 's modest house , while on the street out front , boys displayed the ANC colors on their shirts , caps and scarves .
At the small four - room home of Elias Motsoaledi , a leading ANC unionist and a former commander in the group 's armed wing , Umkhonto we Sizwe , well - wishers stuck little ANC flags in their hair and a man tooted on an antelope horn wrapped in ANC ribbons .
`` I am happy to see the spirit of the people , '' said Mr. Sisulu , looking dapper in a new gray suit .
As the crowd outside his home shouted `` ANC , ANC , '' the old man shot his fists into the air .
`` I 'm inspired by the mood of the people . ''
Under the laws of the land , the ANC remains an illegal organization , and its headquarters are still in Lusaka , Zambia .
But the unconditional release of the seven leaders , who once formed the intellectual and organizational core of the ANC , is a de facto unbanning of the movement and the rebirth of its internal wing .
`` The government can never put the ANC back into the bottle again , '' said Cassim Saloojee , a veteran anti-apartheid activist on hand to welcome Mr. Sisulu .
`` Things have gone too far for the government to stop them now .
There 's no turning back . ''
There was certainly no stopping the tide of ANC emotion last night , when hundreds of people jammed into the Holy Cross Anglican Church in Soweto for what became the first ANC rally in the country in 30 years .
Deafening chants of `` ANC '' and `` Umkhonto we Sizwe '' shook the church as the seven aging men vowed that the ANC would continue its fight against the government and the policies of racial segregation on all fronts , including the armed struggle .
And they called on the government to release Nelson Mandela , the ANC 's leading figure , who was jailed with them and remains in prison .
Without him , said Mr. Sisulu , the freeing of the others `` is only a half - measure . ''
President F.W. de Klerk released the ANC men -- along with one of the founding members of the Pan Africanist Congress , a rival liberation group -- as part of his efforts to create a climate of trust and peace in which his government can begin negotiations with black leaders over a new constitution aimed at giving blacks a voice in national government .
But Pretoria may instead be creating a climate for more turmoil and uncertainty in this racially divided country .
As other repressive governments , particularly Poland and the Soviet Union , have recently discovered , initial steps to open up society can create a momentum for radical change that becomes difficult , if not impossible , to control .
As the days go by , the South African government will be ever more hard pressed to justify the continued imprisonment of Mr. Mandela as well as the continued banning of the ANC and enforcement of the state of emergency .
If it does n't yield on these matters , and eventually begin talking directly to the ANC , the expectations and promise raised by yesterday 's releases will turn to disillusionment and unrest .
If it does , the large number of right - wing whites , who oppose any concessions to the black majority , will step up their agitation and threats to take matters into their own hands .
The newly released ANC leaders also will be under enormous pressure .
The government is watching closely to see if their presence in the townships leads to increased anti-government protests and violence ; if it does , Pretoria will use this as a reason to keep Mr. Mandela behind bars .
Pretoria has n't forgotten why they were all sentenced to life imprisonment in the first place : for sabotage and conspiracy to overthrow the government .
In addition , the government is figuring that the releases could create a split between the internal and external wings of the ANC and between the newly freed leaders and those activists who have emerged as leaders inside the country during their imprisonment .
In order to head off any divisions , Mr. Mandela , in a meeting with his colleagues before they were released , instructed them to report to the ANC headquarters in Lusaka as soon as possible .
The men also will be faced with bridging the generation gap between themselves and the country 's many militant black youths , the so - called young lions who are anxious to see the old lions in action .
Says Peter Mokaba , president of the South African Youth Congress : `` We will be expecting them to act like leaders of the ANC . ''
They never considered themselves to be anything else .
At last night 's rally , they called on their followers to be firm , yet disciplined , in their opposition to apartheid .
`` We emphasize discipline because we know that the government is very , very sensitive , '' said Andrew Mlangeni , another early Umkhonto leader who is now 63 .
`` We want to see Nelson Mandela and all our comrades out of prison , and if we are n't disciplined we may not see them here with us .
The economy 's temperature will be taken from several vantage points this week , with readings on trade , output , housing and inflation .
The most troublesome report may be the August merchandise trade deficit due out tomorrow .
The trade gap is expected to widen to about $ 9 billion from July 's $ 7.6 billion , according to a survey by MMS International , a unit of McGraw - Hill Inc. , New York .
Thursday 's report on the September consumer price index is expected to rise , although not as sharply as the 0.9 % gain reported Friday in the producer price index .
That gain was being cited as a reason the stock market was down early in Friday 's session , before it got started on its reckless 190 - point plunge .
Economists are divided as to how much manufacturing strength they expect to see in September reports on industrial production and capacity utilization , also due tomorrow .
Meanwhile , September housing starts , due Wednesday , are thought to have inched upward .
`` There 's a possibility of a surprise '' in the trade report , said Michael Englund , director of research at MMS .
A widening of the deficit , if it were combined with a stubbornly strong dollar , would exacerbate trade problems -- but the dollar weakened Friday as stocks plummeted .
In any event , Mr. Englund and many others say that the easy gains in narrowing the trade gap have already been made .
`` Trade is definitely going to be more politically sensitive over the next six or seven months as improvement begins to slow , '' he said .
Exports are thought to have risen strongly in August , but probably not enough to offset the jump in imports , economists said .
Views on manufacturing strength are split between economists who read September 's low level of factory job growth as a sign of a slowdown and those who use the somewhat more comforting total employment figures in their calculations .
The wide range of estimates for the industrial output number underscores the differences : The forecasts run from a drop of 0.5 % to an increase of 0.4 % , according to MMS .
A rebound in energy prices , which helped push up the producer price index , is expected to do the same in the consumer price report .
The consensus view expects a 0.4 % increase in the September CPI after a flat reading in August .
Robert H. Chandross , an economist for Lloyd 's Bank in New York , is among those expecting a more moderate gain in the CPI than in prices at the producer level .
`` Auto prices had a big effect in the PPI , and at the CPI level they wo n't , '' he said .
Food prices are expected to be unchanged , but energy costs jumped as much as 4 % , said Gary Ciminero , economist at Fleet / Norstar Financial Group .
He also says he thinks `` core inflation , '' which excludes the volatile food and energy prices , was strong last month .
He expects a gain of as much as 0.5 % in core inflation after a summer of far smaller increases .
Housing starts are expected to quicken a bit from August 's annual pace of 1,350,000 units .
Economists say an August rebound in permits for multifamily units signaled an increase in September starts , though activity remains fairly modest by historical standards .

Assuming the stock market does n't crash again and completely discredit yuppies and trading rooms , American television audiences in a few months may be seeing Britain 's concept of both .
`` Capital City '' is a weekly series that premiered here three weeks ago amid unprecedented hype by its producer , Thames Television .
The early episodes make you long for a rerun of the crash of 1987 .
Let 's make that 1929 , just to be sure .
According to the program 's publicity prospectus , `` Capital City , '' set at Shane Longman , a fictional mid-sized securities firm with # 500 million capital , `` follows the fortunes of a close - knit team of young , high - flying dealers , hired for their particular blend of style , genius and energy .
But with all the money and glamour of high finance come the relentless pressures to do well ; pressure to pull off another million before lunch ; pressure to anticipate the market by a fraction of a second ... ''
You need n't be a high - powered securities lawyer to realize the prospectus is guilty of less than full disclosure .
The slickly produced series has been criticized by London 's financial cognoscenti as inaccurate in detail , but its major weakness is its unrealistic depiction of the characters ' professional and private lives .
Turned loose in Shane Longman 's trading room , the yuppie dealers do little right .
Judging by the money lost and mistakes made in the early episodes , Shane Longman 's capital should be just about exhausted by the final 13th week .
In the opening episode we learn that Michelle , a junior bond trader , has indeed pulled off another million before lunch .
Trouble is , she has lost it just as quickly .
Rather than keep the loss a secret from the outside world , Michelle blabs about it to a sandwich man while ordering lunch over the phone .
Little chance that Shane Longman is going to recoup today .
Traders spend the morning frantically selling bonds , in the belief that the U.S. monthly trade figures will look lousy .
Ah , perfidious Columbia !
The trade figures turn out well , and all those recently unloaded bonds spurt in price .
So much for anticipating the market by a fraction of a second .
And a large slice of the first episode is devoted to efforts to get rid of some nearly worthless Japanese bonds -LRB- since when is anything Japanese nearly worthless nowadays ? -RRB- .
Surprisingly , Shane Longman survives the week , only to have a senior executive innocently bumble his way into becoming the target of a criminal insider trading investigation .
Instead of closing ranks to protect the firm 's reputation , the executive 's internal rivals , led by a loutish American , demand his resignation .
The plot is thwarted when the firm 's major stockholder , kelp farming on the other side of the globe , hurries home to support the executive .
But the investigation continues .
If you can swallow the premise that the rewards for such ineptitude are six - figure salaries , you still are left puzzled , because few of the yuppies consume very conspicuously .
In fact , few consume much of anything .
Two share a house almost devoid of furniture .
Michelle lives in a hotel room , and although she drives a canary - colored Porsche , she has n't time to clean or repair it ; the beat - up vehicle can be started only with a huge pair of pliers because the ignition key has broken off in the lock .
And it takes Declan , the obligatory ladies ' man of the cast , until the third episode to get past first base with any of his prey .
Perhaps the explanation for these anomalies is that class - conscious Britain is n't ready to come to terms with the wealth created by the Thatcherian free - enterprise regime .
After all , this is n't old money , but new money , and in many cases , young money .
This attitude is clearly illustrated in the treatment of Max , the trading room 's most flamboyant character .
Yuppily enough , he lives in a lavishly furnished converted church , wears designer clothes and drives an antique car .
But apparently to make him palatable , even lovable , to the masses , the script inflates pony - tailed Max into an eccentric genius , master of 11 Chinese dialects .
He takes his wash to the laundromat , where he meets a punky French girl who dupes him into providing a home for her pet piranha and then promptly steals his car and dumps it in Dieppe .
In producing and promoting `` Capital City , '' Thames has spent about as much as Shane Longman loses on a good day .
The production costs are a not inconsiderable # 8 million -LRB- $ 12.4 million -RRB- , and would have been much higher had not the cost of the trading floor set been absorbed in the budget of `` Dealers , '' an earlier made - for - TV movie .
Another half million quid went for a volley of full - page advertisements in six major British newspapers and for huge posters in the London subway .
These expenses create a special incentive for `` Capital City 's '' producers to flog it , or a Yank - oriented version of it , in America .
Thames 's U.S. marketing agent , Donald Taffner , is preparing to do just that .
He is discreetly hopeful , citing three U.S. comedy series -- `` Three 's Company , '' `` Too Close for Comfort '' and `` Check It Out '' -- that had British antecedents .
Perhaps without realizing it , Mr. Taffner simultaneously has put his finger on the problem and an ideal solution : `` Capital City '' should have been a comedy , a worthy sequel to the screwball British `` Carry On '' movies of the 1960s .
The seeds already are in the script .
The first episode concluded with a marvelously cute scene in which the trading - room crew minded a baby , the casualty of a broken marriage at the firm .
And many in the young cast bear striking resemblances to American TV and movie personalities known for light roles .
Joanna Kanska looks like a young Zsa Zsa Gabor ; William Armstrong , who plays Max , could pass for Hans Conreid , and Douglas Hodge -LRB- Declan -RRB- for James Farentino ; Rolf Saxon is a passable Tommy Noonan and Dorian Healy could easily double for Huntz Hall , the blank - faced foil of the Bowery Boys comedies .
So , OK kids , everybody on stage for `` Carry On Trading '' : The cast is frantically searching the office for misplaced Japanese bonds that suddenly have soared in value because Dai - Ichi Kangyo Bank has just bought the White House .
The pressure is too much for Zsa Zsa , who slaps a security guard .
He backflips into a desktop computer terminal , which explodes , covering Huntz Hall 's face with microchips .
And all the while , the bonds are in the baby 's diaper .
It should run forever .

Axa - Midi Assurances of France gave details of its financing plans for its proposed $ 4.5 billion acquisition of Farmers Group Inc. , in amended filings with insurance regulators in the nine U.S. states where Farmers operates .
The proposed acquisition is part of Sir James Goldsmith 's unfriendly takeover attempt for B.A.T Industries PLC , the British tobacco , retailing , paper and financial services concern that is parent of Los Angeles - based Farmers .
In an attempt to appease U.S. regulators ' concern over a Goldsmith acquisition of Farmers , Sir James in August agreed to sell Farmers to Axa if he is successful in acquiring B.A.T .
As part of the agreement , Axa agreed to invest $ 1 billion in Hoylake Investments Ltd. , Sir James 's acquisition vehicle .
Of the total $ 5.5 billion to be paid to Hoylake by Axa , about $ 1 billion will come from available resources of Axa 's parent , Axa - Midi Group , $ 2.25 billion will be in the form of notes issued by Axa , and the remaining $ 2.25 billion will be in long - term bank loans .
In an interview Thursday , Claude Bebear , chairman and chief executive officer of Axa , said his group has already obtained assurances from a group of banks led by Cie . Financiere de Paribas that they can provide the loan portion of the financing .
The other banking companies in the group are Credit Lyonnais , Societe Generale , BankAmerica Corp. and Citicorp , he said .
Mr. Bebear said Axa - Midi Group has `` more than $ 2.5 billion of non-strategic assets that we can and will sell '' to help pay off debt from the acquisition .
He said the assets to be sold would be `` non-insurance '' assets , including a beer company and a real estate firm , and would n't include any pieces of Farmers .
`` We wo n't put any burden on Farmers , '' he said .
The amended filings also point out that under a new agreement , Hoylake has an absolute obligation to sell Farmers to Axa upon an acquisition of B.A.T .
`` We hope that with what we did , the regulators will not need to evaluate Hoylake , and they can directly look at the agreement with us , because Hoylake wo n't be an owner of Farmers at anytime , '' Mr. Bebear said .
Any change of control in Farmers needs approval of the insurance commissioners in the nine states where Farmers and its related companies are incorporated .
The amended filings were required because of the new agreement between Axa and Hoylake , and to reflect the extension that Sir James received last month under British takeover rules to complete his proposed acquisition .
Hoylake dropped its initial # 13.35 billion -LRB- $ 20.71 billion -RRB- takeover bid after it received the extension , but said it would launch a new bid if and when the propsed sale of Farmers to Axa receives regulatory approval .
A spokesman for B.A.T said of the amended filings that , `` It would appear that nothing substantive has changed .
The new financing structure is still a very - highly leveraged one , and Axa still plans to take out 75 % of Farmers ' earnings as dividends to service their debt . ''
That dividend is almost double the 35 % currently taken out of Farmers by B.A.T , the spokesman added .
`` It would have severe implications for Farmers ' policy holders . ''
To fend off Sir James 's advances , B.A.T has proposed a sweeping restructuring that would pare it to a tobacco and financial services concern .
Dismal sales at General Motors Corp. dragged the U.S. car and truck market down below year - ago levels in early October , the first sales period of the 1990 model year .
The eight major domestic auto makers sold 160,510 North American - made cars in the first 10 days of October , a 12.6 % drop from a year earlier .
Domestically built truck sales were down 10.4 % to 86,555 pickups , vans and sport utility vehicles .
The heavy use of incentives to clear out 1989 models appears to have taken the steam , at least initially , out of 1990 model sales , which began officially Oct. 1 .
This appears particularly true at GM , which had strong sales in August and September but saw its early October car and truck results fall 26.3 % from last year 's unusually high level .
Overall , sales of all domestic - made vehicles fell 11.9 % from a year ago .
Without GM , overall sales for the other U.S. automakers were roughly flat with 1989 results .
Some of the U.S. auto makers have already adopted incentives on many 1990 models , but they may have to broaden their programs to keep sales up .
`` We 've created a condition where , without incentives , it 's a tough market , '' said Tom Kelly , sales manager for Bill Wink Chevrolet in Dearborn , Mich .
Car sales fell to a seasonally adjusted annual selling rate of 5.8 million vehicles , the lowest since October 1987 .
The poor performance contrasts with a robust selling rate of almost eight million last month .
Furthermore , dealers contacted late last week said they could n't see any immediate impact on sales of Friday 's steep market decline .
GM 's domestic car sales dropped 24.3 % and its domestic trucks were down an even steeper 28.7 % from the same period a year ago .
All of the GM divisions except Cadillac showed big declines .
Cadillac posted a 3.2 % increase despite new competition from Lexus , the fledging luxury - car division of Toyota Motor Corp .
Lexus sales were n't available ; the cars are imported and Toyota reports their sales only at month - end .
The sales drop for the No. 1 car maker may have been caused in part by the end in September of dealer incentives that GM offered in addition to consumer rebates and low - interest financing , a company spokesman said .
Last year , GM had a different program in place that continued rewarding dealers until all the 1989 models had been sold .
Aside from GM , other car makers posted generally mixed results .
Ford Motor Co. had a 1.8 % drop in domestic car sales but a 2.4 % increase in domestic truck sales .
Chrysler Corp. had a 7.5 % drop in car sales , echoing its generally slow performance all year .
However , sales of trucks , including the company 's popular minivans , rose 4.3 % .
Honda Motor Co. 's sales of domestically built vehicles plunged 21.7 % from a year earlier .
Honda 's plant in Marysville , Ohio , was gearing up to build 1990 model Accords , a Honda spokesman said .
`` We 're really confident everything will bounce back to normal , '' he added .
Separately , Chrysler said firm prices on its 1990 - model domestic cars and minivans will rise an average of 5 % over comparably equipped 1989 models .
Firm prices were generally in line with the tentative prices announced earlier this fall .
At that time , Chrysler said base prices , which are n't adjusted for equipment changes , would rise between 4 % and 9 % on most vehicle .
a - Totals include only vehicle sales reported in period .
c - Domestic car
d - Percentage change is greater than 999 % .
x - There were 8 selling days in the most recent period and 8 a year earlier .
Percentage differences based on daily sales rate rather than sales volume .

It was n't so long ago that a radio network funded by the U.S. Congress -- and originally by the Central Intelligence Agency -- was accused by officials here of employing propagandists , imperialists and spies .
Now , the network has opened a news bureau in the Hungarian capital .
Employees held an open house to celebrate and even hung out a sign : `` Szabad Europa Radio '' -- Radio Free Europe .
`` I think this is a victory for the radio , '' says Barnabas de Bueky , a 55 - year - old former Hungarian refugee who works in the Munich , West Germany , headquarters as deputy director of the Hungarian service .
In fact , the network hopes to set up offices in Warsaw and anywhere else in the East Bloc that will have it .
But the rapid changes brought on by glasnost and open borders are altering the network 's life in more ways than one .
In fact , Radio Free Europe is in danger of suffering from its success .
While the network currently can operate freely in Budapest , so can others .
In addition , competition for listeners is getting tougher in many ways than when broadcasting here was strictly controlled .
Instead of being denounced as an evil agent of imperialism , Radio Free Europe is more likely to draw the criticism that its programs are too tame , even boring .
`` They have a lot to do these days to compete with Hungarian radio , '' says Andrew Deak , a computer - science student at the Technical University in Budapest .
`` The Hungarian -LCB- radio -RCB- reporters seem better informed and more critical about about what 's going on here . ''
Indeed , Hungary is in the midst of a media explosion .
Boys on busy street corners peddle newspapers of every political stripe .
Newsstands are packed with a colorful array of magazines .
Radio and television are getting livelier and bolder .
The British Broadcasting Corp. and the U.S. State Department 's Voice of America broadcast over Hungarian airwaves , though only a few hours a day each in Hungarian .
Australian press magnate Rupert Murdoch has bought 50 % stakes in two popular and gossipy Hungarian newspapers , while Britain 's Robert Maxwell has let it be known here that he is thinking about similar moves .
But Radio Free Europe does n't plan to fade away .
With its mission for free speech and the capitalist way , the network 's staff says it still has plenty to do -- in Hungary and in the `` Great Eastern Beyond . ''
Radio Free Europe and its sister station for the Soviet Union , Radio Liberty , say they wo n't cut back their more than 19 hours of daily broadcasts .
They are still an important source of news for 60 million listeners in 23 exotic tongues : from Bulgarian and Belorussian to Kazakh and Kirghiz .
The establishment of its first bureau in Warsaw Pact territory shows the depth of some of the changes in Eastern Europe .
Months before the decision by the Hungarian Communist Party to rename itself Socialist and try to look more appealing to voters , the country 's rulers were trying to look more hospitable .
It proved a perfect time for Radio Free Europe to ask for permission to set up office .
Not only did the Hungarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs approve Radio Free Europe 's new location , but the Ministry of Telecommunications did something even more amazing : `` They found us four phone lines in central Budapest , '' says Geza Szocs , a Radio Free Europe correspondent who helped organize the Budapest location .
`` That is a miracle . ''
It 's a far cry from the previous treatment of the network , which had to overcome jamming of its frequencies and intimidation of local correspondents -LRB- who filed reports to the network by phone , secret messengers or letters -RRB- .
In fact , some of the network 's Hungarian listeners say they owe Radio Free Europe loyalty because it was responsible in many ways for keeping hope alive through what one writer here calls the `` Dark Ages of the 20th Century . ''
`` During the past four years , many of us have sat up until late at night listening to our radios , '' says the writer .
`` There were some very brave broadcasts . ''
The listeners , too , had to be brave .
Through much of the post-World War II period , listening to Western broadcasts was a crime in Hungary .
`` When we listen to the Europe station , my mother still gets nervous , '' says a Budapest translator .
`` She wants to turn down the volume and close the curtains . ''
Now , the toughest competition for Radio Free Europe comes during the late - night slot .
Hungarian radio often saves its most politically outspoken broadcasts for around midnight .
Television , which most of the time is considered rather tame , has entered the running with a new program , `` The End of the Day , '' which comes on after 11 p.m .
It is a talk show with opposition leaders and political experts who discuss Hungary 's domestic problems as well as foreign affairs .
Those who want to hear even more radical views have to get up at five on Sunday morning for `` Sunday Journal , '' on Hungarian Radio .
The competitive spirit is clearly influencing Radio Free Europe , which is trying to beef up programs .
The Budapest office plans to hire free - lance reporters to cover the latest happenings in Hungarian country towns from Nagykanizsa in the west to Nyiregyhaza in the east .
The Hungarian service has a daily 40 - minute news show called Newsreel , with international and domestic news , plus a daily news review of opinions from around the world .
There 's also a host of new programs , trying to lighten up on the traditional diet of politics .
A daily 35 - minute program called `` The March of Time '' tries to find interesting tidbits of lighthearted news and gossip from around the world .
There 's a program for women and a science show .
And to attract younger listeners , Radio Free Europe intersperses the latest in Western rock groups .
The Pet Shop Boys are big this year in Budapest .
`` We are starving for all the news , '' says Mr. Deak , the student .
`` Every moment we want to know everything about the world .
Proposals for government - operated `` national service , '' like influenza , flare up from time to time , depress the resistance of the body politic , run their course , and seem to disappear , only to mutate and afflict public life anew .
The disease metaphor comes to mind , of course , not as an aspersion on the advocates of national service .
Rather , it is born of frustration with having to combat constantly changing strains of a statist idea that one thought had been eliminated in the early 1970s , along with smallpox .
It is back with us again , in the form of legislation to pay volunteers under a `` National and Community Service Act , '' a proposal with a serious shot at congressional passage this fall .
Why does the national - service virus keep coming back ?
Perhaps it is because utopian nostalgia evokes both military experience and the social gospel .
If only we could get America 's wastrel youth into at least a psychic uniform we might be able to teach self - discipline again and revive the spirit of giving .
A quarter of a century ago national service was promoted as a way of curing the manifest inequities of the draft -- by , of all things , expanding the draft .
Those of us who resisted the idea then suspect today that an obligation of government service for all young people is still the true long - term aim of many national - service backers , despite their protests that present plans contain no coercion .
Choice of the volunteer military in the 1970s seemed to doom national service as much as the draft .
But the virus was kept alive in sociology departments until a couple of years ago , when it again was let loose .
This time it attempted to invade two connected problems , the rising cost of higher education and the rising expense to the federal government of educational grants and loans .
Why not keep and even expand the loans and grants , the advocates reasoned , but require some form of service from each recipient ?
Military service , moreover , could be a national - service option .
Thus , undoubtedly it was hoped that the new strain of national service would prove contagious , infecting patriotic conservatives , pay - as - you - go moderates , and idealistic liberals .
The Democratic Leadership Council , a centrist group sponsoring the plan , surely thought it might help the party to attract support , especially among college students and their parents .
A provision allowing grants to be applied to first - home purchases was added to appeal to those who had had enough of schooling .
The DLC plan envisaged `` volunteers '' planting trees , emptying bedpans , tutoring children , and assisting librarians for $ 100 a week , tax free , plus medical care .
With a tax - free $ 10,000 voucher payment at the end of each year , the volunteers would be making a wage comparable to $ 17,500 a year .
Mind you , most of `` the volunteers '' would be unskilled 17 - to 18 - year - olds , some not even high school graduates , and many saving money by living at home .
They would be doing better financially under national service than many taxpayers working at the same kinds of jobs and perhaps supporting families .
As it happened , political resistance developed among educational and minority interests that count on the present education grant system , so the national - service devotees decided to abandon the supposedly crucial principle of `` give in order to get . ''
Opposition to national service from the Pentagon , which wants to protect its own recruitment process , also led to the military - service option being dropped .
Clearly , a new rationale for national service had to be cooked up .
What better place to turn than Sen. Edward Kennedy 's Labor Committee , that great stove of government expansionism , where many a stagnant pot of porridge is kept on the back burner until it can be brought forward and presented as nouvelle cuisine ?
In this case , the new recipe for national service called for throwing many assorted legislative leftovers into one kettle : a demonstration project for educational aid -LRB- particularly satisfying to the DLC and Sen. Sam Nunn -RRB- , a similar demonstration program for youth conservation -LRB- a la Sen. Chris Dodd -RRB- , a competitive grants program to states to spark youth and senior citizen volunteer projects -LRB- a Kennedy specialty -RRB- , a community service work - study program for students -LRB- pleasing to the palate of Sen. Dale Bumpers , among others -RRB- , plus engorgement of the VISTA volunteer program and the Retired Senior Volunteer , Foster Grandparent , and Senior Companion programs .
Before the menu is printed , the House may add more ingredients , also changing the initial price , now posted at some $ 330 million .
It is widely known that `` too many cooks spoil the broth , '' but that wisdom does not necessarily reflect the view of the cooks , especially if they are senators .
The `` omnibus '' bill coming out of Congress may be unwholesome glop , but the assorted chefs are happy and the restaurant is pushing the dish very hard .
The aroma of patronage is in the air .
Is the voluntary sector so weak that it needs such unsolicited assistance ?
On the contrary , it is as robust as ever .
According to the Gallup Poll , American adults contribute an average of two hours a week of service , while financial contributions to charity in the 1980s have risen 30 % -LRB- adjusted for inflation -RRB- .
Even if government does see various `` unmet needs , '' national service is not the way to meet them .
If we want to support students , we might adopt the idea used in other countries of offering more scholarships based on something called `` scholarship , '' rather than on the government 's idea of `` service . ''
Or we might provide a tax credit for working students .
What we do not need to do is start a war , and then try to justify it by creating a GI Bill .
To the extent we lack manpower to staff menial jobs in hospitals , for example , we should raise pay , pursue labor - saving technology , or allow more legal immigration , rather than overpay high school graduates as short - term workers and cause resentment among permanent workers paid lesser amounts to do the same jobs .
Will national service , in the current highly politicized and opportunistic form exert enough appeal to get adopted ?
Not necessarily .
Polls show wide , generalized support for some vague concept of service , but the bill now under discussion lacks any passionate public backing .
Nonetheless , Senate Democrats are organizing a roll of supporting `` associations , '' `` societies '' and `` councils , '' some of which may hope to receive the paid `` volunteers . ''
So far , the president seems ill - disposed to substitute any of the omnibus for his own free - standing proposal to endow a `` Points of Light '' foundation with $ 25 million to inform citizens of all ages and exhort them to genuine volunteerism .
However , even this admirable plan could become objectionable if the White House gives in to congressional Democratic pressure to add to the scope of the president 's initiative or to involve the independent foundation in `` brokering '' federal funds for volunteer projects .
There 's no need for such concessions .
The omnibus can be defeated , the virus controlled , and real service protected .
National service , the utopian idea , still wo n't go away then , of course , but the millions of knee - socked youth performing works of `` civic content '' will be mobilized only in the imagination of their progenitors .

American Physicians Service Group Inc. said it purchased about 42 % of Prime Medical Services Inc. for about $ 5 million from Texas American Energy Corp .
American Physicians said it also replaced four Texas American representatives on Prime 's five - member board .
American provides a variety of financial services to doctors and hospitals .
Prime , based in Bedminster , N.J. , provides management services to cardiac rehabilitation clinics and diagnostic imaging centers .
For the year ended June 30 , Prime had a net loss of $ 3 million on sales of $ 13.8 million .
The inflation - adjusted growth rate for France 's gross domestic product for the second quarter was revised upward to 0.8 % from the previous three months from the initial estimate of 0.7 % , the National Statistics Institute said .
The state agency said the latest revision left the growth rate for the first - quarter compared with the previous three months unchanged at 1.3 % .
If the economy continues to expand by 0.8 % a quarter for the rest of the year , it would leave GDP growth for all of 1989 at 3 % , the institute said .
That would be down from the 3.8 % rise posted in 1988 .
The Canadian government announced a new , 12 - year Canada Savings Bond issue that will yield investors 10.5 % in the first year .
The annual interest rate for each of the next 11 years will be set each fall , when details of a new series are released .
Canada Savings Bonds are major government instruments for meeting its financial requirements .
The government has about 41.4 billion Canadian dollars -LRB- US$ 35.2 billion -RRB- of such bonds currently outstanding .
Only Canadian residents are permitted to buy Canada Savings Bonds , which may be redeemed any time at face value .
The bonds go on sale Oct. 19 .
The debate over National Service has begun again .
After a decade in which more than 50 localities established their own service or conservation corps and dozens of school systems made community service a prerequisite to high - school graduation , the focus has shifted to Washington .
At least 10 bills proposing one or another national program were introduced in Congress this spring .
One , co-sponsored by Sen. Sam Nunn -LRB- D. , Ga . -RRB- and Rep. Dave McCurdy -LRB- D. , Okla. -RRB- , would have restricted federal college subsidies to students who had served .
An omnibus bill assembled by Sen. Edward Kennedy -LRB- D. , Mass. -RRB- , and including some diluted Nunn - McCurdy provisions along with proposals by fellow Democratic Sens. Claiborne Pell , Barbara Mikulski and Christopher Dodd , has been reported out of the Senate Labor Committee .
It might well win Senate passage .
President Bush has outlined his own Youth Entering Service -LRB- YES -RRB- plan , though its details remain to be specified .
What is one to think of all this ?
Doctrine and special interests govern some responses .
People eager to have youth `` pay their dues to society '' favor service proposals -- preferably mandatory ones .
So do those who seek a `` re-energized concept of citizenship , '' a concept imposing stern obligations as well as conferring rights .
Then there are instinctive opponents .
To libertarians , mandatory service is an abomination and voluntary systems are illegitimate uses of tax money .
Devotees of the market question the value of the work national service would perform :
If the market wo n't pay for it , they argue , it ca n't be worth its cost .
Elements of the left are also reflexively opposed ; they see service as a cover for the draft , or fear the regimentation of youth , or want to see rights enlarged , not obligations .
But what about those of us whose views are not predetermined by formula or ideology ?
How should we think about national service ?
Let 's begin by recognizing a main source of confusion -- `` national service '' has no agreed meaning .
Would service be voluntary or compulsory ?
Short or long ?
Part - time or full - time ?
Paid or unpaid ?
Would participants live at home and work nearby or live in barracks and work on public lands ?
What kinds of work would they do ?
What does `` national '' mean ?
Would the program be run by the federal government , by local governments , or by private voluntary organizations ?
And who would serve ?
Only males , as with the draft , or both sexes ?
Youth only or all ages ?
Middle - class people , or poor people , or a genuine cross-section ?
Many or few ?
Those are not trivial questions , and the label `` national service '' answers none of them .
Then how should we think about national service ?
As a starting point , here are five propositions : 1 . Consider the ingredients , not the name .
Ignore `` national service '' in the abstract ; consider specific proposals .
They will differ in crucial ways .
2 . `` Service '' should be service .
As commonly understood , service implies sacrifice .
It involves accepting risk , or giving up income , or deferring a career .
It follows that proposals like Nunn - McCurdy , whose benefits to enrollees are worth some $ 17,500 a year , do not qualify .
There is a rationale for such bills : Federal subsidies to college students amount to `` a GI Bill without the GI '' ; arguably those benefits should be earned , not given .
But the earnings exceed by 20 % the average income of young high - school graduates with full - time jobs .
Why call that service ?
3 . Encouragement is fine ; compulsion is not .
Compelled service is unconstitutional .
It is also unwise and unenforceable .
-LRB- Who will throw several hundred thousand refusers in jail each year ? -RRB-
But through tax policy and in other ways the federal government encourages many kinds of behavior .
It should also encourage service -- preferably by all classes and all ages .
Its encouragement should strengthen and not undercut the strong tradition of volunteering in the U.S. , should build on the service programs already in existence , and should honor local convictions about which tasks most need doing .
4 . Good programs are not cheap .
Enthusiasts assume that national service would get important work done cheaply : forest fires fought , housing rehabilitated , students tutored , day - care centers staffed .
There is important work to be done , and existing service and conservation corps have shown that even youths who start with few skills can do much of it well -- but not cheaply .
Good service programs require recruitment , screening , training and supervision -- all of high quality .
They involve stipends to participants .
Full - time residential programs also require housing and full - time supervision ; they are particularly expensive -- more per participant than a year at Stanford or Yale .
Non-residential programs are cheaper , but good ones still come to some $ 10,000 a year .
Are they worth that ?
Evaluations suggest that good ones are -- especially so if the effects on participants are counted .
But the calculations are challengeable .
5 . Underclass youth are a special concern .
Are such expenditures worthwhile , then ?
Yes , if targeted .
People of all ages and all classes should be encouraged to serve , but there are many ways for middle - class kids , and their elders , to serve at little public cost .
They can volunteer at any of thousands of non-profit institutions , or participate in service programs required by high schools or encouraged by colleges or employers .
Underclass youth do n't have those opportunities .
They are not enrolled in high school or college .
They are unlikely to be employed .
And they have grown up in unprecedentedly grim circumstances , among family structures breaking down , surrounded by self - destructive behaviors and bleak prospects .
But many of them can be quite profoundly reoriented by productive and disciplined service .
Some wo n't accept the discipline ; others drop out for other reasons .
But some whom nothing else is reaching are transformed .
Learning skills , producing something cooperatively , feeling useful , they are no longer dependent -- others now depend on them .
Even if it is cheaper to build playgrounds or paint apartments or plant dune - grass with paid professionals , the effects on the young people providing those services alter the calculation .
Strictly speaking , these youth are not performing service .
They are giving up no income , deferring no careers , incurring no risk .
But they believe themselves to be serving , and they begin to respect themselves -LRB- and others -RRB- , to take control of their lives , to think of the future .
That is a service to the nation .
It is what federal support should try hardest to achieve .

Government officials here and in other countries laid plans through the weekend to head off a Monday market meltdown -- but went out of their way to keep their moves quiet .
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan was on the telephones , making it clear to officials in the U.S. and abroad that the Fed was prepared to inject massive amounts of money into the banking system , as it did in October 1987 , if the action were needed to prevent a financial crisis .
And at the Treasury , Secretary Nicholas Brady talked with friends and associates on Wall Street while Assistant Secretary David Mullins carefully analyzed data on the Friday market plunge .
But the officials feared that any public announcements would only increase market jitters .
In addition , officials at the Fed and in the Bush administration decided that avoiding overt actions and statements over the weekend would give them more strength and flexibility should Friday 's market drop turn into this morning 's rout .
`` The disadvantage at this point is that anything you do that looks like you are doing too much tends to reinforce a sense of crisis , '' said one government official , insisting on anonymity .
The Fed 's efforts at secrecy were partly foiled Sunday morning , when both the New York Times and the Washington Post carried stories quoting a senior Fed official saying the central bank was prepared to pour cash into the banking system Monday morning .
Fed Chairman Greenspan was surprised by both stories , according to knowledgeable sources , and insisted he had n't authorized any public comment .
Nevertheless , Fed officials acknowledged the stories were reasonably accurate portrayals of the central bank 's game plan .
It is prepared to assume the same role it played in October 1987 , providing money to the markets if necessary to keep the financial system afloat .
The Fed provides money to the banking system by buying government securities from financial institutions .
The reticence of federal officials was evident in the appearance Sunday of Budget Director Richard Darman on ABC 's `` This Week . ''
`` Secretary of the Treasury Brady and Chairman Greenspan and the chairman of the SEC and others have been in close contact .
I 'm sure they 'll do what 's right , what 's prudent , what 's sensible , '' he said .
When it was suggested his comment was a `` non-answer , '' Mr. Darman replied : `` It is a non-answer .
But , in this context , that 's the smart thing to do . ''
At the Treasury , Secretary Brady issued a statement minimizing the stock market 's drop .
`` Today 's stock market decline does n't signal any fundamental change in the condition of the economy , '' he said .
`` The economy remains well - balanced , and the outlook is for continued moderate growth . ''
But administration officials conceded that Friday 's drop carried the chance of further declines this week .
`` One possibility is that this is a surgical setback , reasonably limited in its breadth , and not a major problem , '' said one senior administration official , who also asked that he not be named .
`` The other is that we see another major disaster , like two years ago .
I think that 's less likely . ''
Nevertheless , Fed Chairman Greenspan and Vice Chairman Manuel Johnson were in their offices Sunday evening , monitoring events as they unfolded in markets around the world .
The action was expected to begin with the opening of the New Zealand foreign exchange markets at 5 p.m. EST -- when stocks there plunged -- and to continue as the trading day began later in the evening in Tokyo and through early this morning in Europe .
Both the Treasury and the Fed planned to keep market rooms operating throughout the night to monitor the developments .
In Tokyo , share prices dropped sharply by 1.7 % in early Monday morning trading .
After the initial slide , the market appeared to be turning around but by early afternoon was headed lower .
In the Bush administration , the lead is being taken by Treasury Secretary Brady , Undersecretary Robert Glauber and Assistant Secretary Mullins .
The three men worked together on the so - called Brady Commission , headed by Mr. Brady , which was established after the 1987 crash to examine the market 's collapse .
As a result they have extensive knowledge in financial markets , and financial market crises .
Mr. Brady was at the White House Friday afternoon when the stock market 's decline began .
He was quickly on the phone with Mr. Mullins , who in turn was talking with the chairmen of the New York and Chicago exchanges .
Later , Mr. Brady phoned Mr. Greenspan , SEC Chairman Richard Breeden and numerous contacts in New York and overseas .
Aides say he continued to work the phones through the weekend .
Administration officials say President Bush was briefed throughout Friday afternoon and evening , even after leaving for Camp David .
He had frequent telephone consultations with Mr. Brady and Michael Boskin , chairman of the counsel of economic advisers .
Government officials tried throughout the weekend to render a business - as - usual appearance in order to avoid any sense of panic .
Treasury Undersecretary David Mulford , for instance , was at a meeting of the Business Council in Hot Springs , Va. , when the stock market fell , and remained there through the following day .
And as of last night , Fed Chairman Greenspan had n't canceled his plans to address the American Bankers Association convention in Washington at 10 a.m. this morning .
Ironically , Mr. Greenspan was scheduled to address the same convention in Dallas on Oct. 20 , 1987 .
He flew to Dallas on Oct. 19 , when the market plummeted 508 points , but then turned around the next morning and returned to Washington without delivering his speech .

The first major event this morning in U.S. stock and futures trading may be a pause at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange .
Under a reform arising from the 1987 crash , trading in the Merc 's stock - index futures will break for 10 minutes if the contract opens and stays five points from Friday 's close , a move equal to 40 points on the Dow Jones Industrial Average .
The aim of the interruption would be to ease the opening of the New York Stock Exchange , which would be hammered by such a volatile move on the Merc .
That early - morning breather is just one of a number of safeguards adopted after the 1987 crash .
The Big Board also added computer capacity to handle huge surges in trading volume .
Several of those post-crash changes kicked in during Friday 's one - hour collapse and worked as expected , even though they did n't prevent a stunning plunge .
But the major `` circuit breakers '' have yet to be evaluated .
A deeper market plunge today could give them their first test .
A further slide also would resurrect debate over a host of other , more sweeping changes proposed -- but not implemented -- after the last crash .
Most notably , several of the regulatory steps recommended by the Brady Task Force , which analyzed the 1987 crash , would be revived -- especially because that group 's chairman is now the Treasury secretary .
The most controversial of the Brady recommendations involved establishing a single overarching regulator to handle crucial cross-market questions , such as setting consistent margin requirements for the stock and futures markets .
But for the moment , attention focuses on the reforms that were put into place , and market regulators and participants said the circuit breakers worked as intended .
Big Board and Merc officials expressed satisfaction with the results of two limits imposed on of the Merc 's Standard & Poor 's 500 contract , as well as `` hot - line '' communications among exchanges .
Those pauses -- from 2:07 p.m. to 2:30 p.m. CDT and from 2:45 p.m. until the close of trading a half - hour later -- forced traders to buy and sell contracts at prices at or higher than their frozen levels .
During the first halt , after the S&P index had fallen 12 points , the Big Board 's `` Sidecar '' computer program automatically was triggered .
That system is designed to separate computer - generated program trades from all other trades to help exchange officials resolve order imbalances in individual stocks .
One Merc broker compared the action in the S&P pit during the two freezes to a fire at a well - drilled school .
`` You do n't want the fire but you know what to do , '' said Howard Dubnow , an independent floor broker and a Merc governor .
`` There was no panic .
The system worked the way we devised it to work . ''
After reopening for about 15 minutes , the S&P index tumbled to its 30 - point limit and the second freeze went into effect .
Traders then spent the last half - hour `` watching to see if the Dow would drop 250 points , '' Mr. Dubnow added , referring to the level at which the stock market itself would have closed for an hour .
One observer estimated that 80 % to 90 % of the S&P traders `` were just standing around watching . ''
But the 250 - point circuit breaker never had to kick in , and freezes on the Chicago Board of Trade 's Major Market Index also were n't triggered .
The MMI and the S&P 500 are the two major indexes used by program traders to run their computerized trading strategies .
The programs are considered by many to be a major cause of the 1987 crash .
The process of post-crash reforms began with calls to remake the markets and wound up a year later with a series of rather technical adjustments .
In October 1987 , just after the market drop , Washington was awash in talk of sweeping changes in the way the financial markets are structured and regulated .
Over the next year that grand agenda was whittled down to a series of steps to soften big stock drops by interrupting trading to give market players time to pause and reconsider positions .
In addition , limits were placed on computer - driven trading , and steps were taken to better link the stock and futures markets .
Few changes were made in the way the markets are regulated .
At the outset the prime target was program trading , which was much discussed but little understood on Capitol Hill .
There were also calls to strip the stock markets of `` derivative '' products , such as stock - index futures and options , which Federal Judge Stanley Sporkin , for example , likened to `` barnacles attached to the basic market . ''
And there was much criticism of the New York Stock Exchange 's system of having stock trades flow through specialists , or market makers .
When the Brady Task Force 's powerful analysis of the crash was released in January 1988 , it immediately reshaped the reformers ' agenda .
Arguing that the separate financial marketplaces acted as one , and concluding that the crash had `` raised the possibility of a full - scale financial system breakdown , '' the presidential task force called for establishing a super-regulator to oversee the markets , to make margins consistent across markets , to unify clearing systems and to install circuit breakers .
Only the last of those recommendations ever was implemented .
The Reagan White House held the Brady recommendations at arm 's length and named a second panel -- the Working Group on the Financial Markets -- to review its analysis and those of other crash studies .
In May 1988 , the Working Group , made up of representatives from the Federal Reserve , the Treasury , the Securities and Exchange Commission , and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission , finally endorsed only circuit breakers .
After several more months of arguments among various stock exchanges and futures markets , circuit breakers were set in place , with the most notable suspending trading after 250 and 400 point drops in the Dow Jones Industrial Average .
Privately , some free marketeers dismissed such mechanisms as sops to interventionists .
After all , this free - market argument went , the Dow only dropped more than 250 points once this century .
`` Circuit breakers '' set to soften big drops :
-- If S&P futures fall 5 points at opening , contract trading pauses for 10 minutes .
-- If Dow Industrials fall 25 points at opening , contract trading pauses for 10 minutes .
-- If S&P futures fall 12 points -LRB- equivalent to about 100 points on DJIA -RRB- , trading is frozen for half hour to that price or higher .
On NYSE program trades are diverted into a separate computer file to determine buy and sell orders .
-- If S&P futures fall 30 points , trading is restricted for an hour to that price or higher .
-- If Dow Industrials fall 250 points , trading on the Big Board halts for an hour .
S&P and MMI contracts also halt .
-- If DJIA drops 400 points , Big Board halts trading for two hours .
Trading in MMI and S&P futures also halted .

Breaking the Soviet government 's television monopoly , an independent company has gained rights to show world programming , including American films .
`` There must not be a monopoly , there must be freedom of choice for both journalists and viewers , '' Nikolai I. Lutsenko , the president of the Nika TV company , told the weekly newspaper Nedelya .
The company is already working on its own programming in several provincial cities and hopes to be on the air regularly in about a year , the newspaper said .
Mr. Lutsenko told Nedelya that he recently had been to the U.S. to pick up the rights to show 5,000 U.S. films in the Soviet Union .
Nedelya 's article was accompanied by a picture of Mr. Lutsenko interviewing singer John Denver in Colorado .
Even though it will be independent of official television , Nika will have an oversight board that will include members of the Communist youth league .
South Africa 's National Union of Mineworkers said that about 10,000 diamond miners struck for higher wages at De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd.
De Beers said that workers at five of the group 's mines were on strike , which it said was peaceful , with orderly picketing occurring at one of the mines .
The deadlock in negotiations occurred with De Beers offering a 17 % increase in the minimum - wage category while the union demanded a 37.6 % increase in the minimum wage .
Japan 's opposition Socialist Party denied that its legislators had been bribed by pinball - parlor owners .
The allegation had been raised in Parliament by the governing Liberal Democratic Party following magazine reports suggesting that money from Japanese - style pinball , called pachinko , had infiltrated politics .
Tsuruo Yamaguchi , secretary general of the Socialist Party , acknowledged that nine party lawmakers had received donations from the pachinko association totaling 8 million yen -LRB- about $ 55,000 -RRB- but said the donations were legal and none of its members acted to favor the industry .
The World Wide Fund for Nature said that Spain , Argentina , Thailand and Indonesia were doing too little to prevent illegal trade in endangered wildlife across their borders .
A report by the conservation group presented at the U.N. - sponsored Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species in Lausanne accused the four of trading protected species ranging from parakeets to orchids .
Fund official Simon Lyster said world trade in wildlife was estimated to total $ 5 billion of business annually .
A NATO project to build a frigate for the 1990s was torpedoed by the pull - out of three of its eight participating nations .

Small wonder that Britain 's Labor Party wants credit controls .
A few hours after the party launched its own affinity credit card earlier this month , the Tories raised the nation 's base interest rate .
Labor 's Visa card is believed to be the first linked to a British political party .
Labor gets 25 pence -LRB- 39 cents -RRB- for every 100 -LRB- about $ 155 -RRB- that a user charges to the card .

China 's year - long austerity program has achieved some successes in harnessing runaway economic growth and stabilizing prices but has failed to eliminate serious defects in state planning and an alarming drain on state budgets .
The official China Daily said retail prices of non-staple foods have n't risen since last December but acknowledged that huge government subsidies were a main factor in keeping prices down .
The State Statistical Bureau found that more than 1 billion yuan -LRB- $ 270 million -RRB- was spent in the first half of the year for pork subsidies .
The newspaper quoted experts as saying the subsidies would cause the difference between prices and real values of commodities to `` become very unreasonable '' and reduce needed funds for investment in the `` already difficult state budget . ''
The aim of the austerity measures was to slice economic growth , which soared to 20.7 % last year , to 8 % in 1990 .
Economists now predict the growth rate will be about 11.5 % for the year .
In a sign of growing official tolerance for religion , Russian Orthodox priests were allowed to celebrate the 400th anniversary of the Moscow patriarchate in the Kremlin 's 15th - century Uspensky Cathedral , where czars were crowned ... .
A 34 - foot - tall , $ 7.7 million statue of Buddha was completed on a hill outside Hong Kong , facing China .
The statue is the brainchild of Sik Chi Wan , director of the Po Lin Monastery , who said : `` Hong Kong is such a prosperous place , we also need some kind of religious symbol .
It all seemed innocent enough : Last April , one Steven B. Iken visited Justin Products Inc. here , identified himself as a potential customer and got the word on the little company 's new cassette players for children .
`` It is almost identical to the Sony product , '' Mr. Iken remarked , after seeing prototypes and pictures .
Replied a Justin salesman : `` Exactly . ''
The Justin merchandise carried wholesale prices some 40 % below those of Sony Corp. of Japan 's `` My First Sony '' line .
The visitor waxed enthusiastic and promised to return .
But instead of a new customer -- part of a hoped - for bonanza from underselling Sony -- Justin got a costly legal morass .
Mr. Iken , it turned out , was a private detective using a hidden tape recorder to gather information for Sony .
His recording later turned up as a court exhibit .
Seeking to keep Justin 's `` My Own '' product line off the U.S. market , Sony last May filed a suit in Manhattan federal court accusing the upstart of trademark infringement , unfair competition and other violations of business law .
Since then , life has changed a lot for 61 - year - old Leonard Kaye , Justin 's owner .
`` I have n't been able to get a decent night 's sleep since this has been going on , '' he says .
`` It 's the most distracting thing in my life -- I ca n't even attend to my business . ''
His company -LRB- annual sales : about $ 25 million -RRB- may suffer a costly blow -- losing an estimated 10 % of total sales -- if Sony -LRB- annual sales : about $ 16 billion -RRB- prevails .
Justin 's plight shows what can happen when a tiny company suddenly faces the full legal might of a wrathful multinational .
With considerable irony , the case also shows how completely Japan has turned the tables on U.S. business .
Americans used to complain bitterly about being undersold by look - alike products from Japan .
Now Sony , whose innovative , premium - priced products are among the most admired in consumer electronics , is bitterly complaining about a little U.S. firm with a cheap look - alike produced in China .
`` The gist of this is that Justin knocked off the Sony line and Sony wants to stop it , '' says Lewis H. Eslinger , Sony 's attorney , who previously guarded Rubik 's Cube .
-LRB- Sony itself declines to comment . -RRB-
If Sony wins , Mr. Eslinger says , its little rival will have to try to sell the products overseas .
At worst , he adds , `` They 'd have to grind them all up and throw them away . ''
Mr. Kaye denies the suit 's charges and says his only mistake was taking on Sony in the marketplace .
`` I made a similar line and I produced it cheaper , '' he says .
Today , U.S. Judge John E. Sprizzo is expected to rule on Sony 's renewed request for a pre-trial order blocking sale of the disputed products , on which deliveries began in July .
The judge turned down an earlier Sony request for such an order -- a decision upheld on appeal -- but Sony returned with additional evidence and arguments .
Though hoping to settle the case , Justin vows to fight on , if necessary .
But the battle is more than Justin bargained for .
`` I had no idea I was getting in so deep , '' says Mr. Kaye , who founded Justin in 1982 .
Mr. Kaye had sold Capetronic Inc. , a Taiwan electronics maker , and retired , only to find he was bored .
With Justin , he began selling toys and electronics made mostly in Hong Kong , beginning with Mickey Mouse radios .
The company has grown -- to about 40 employees , from four initially , Mr. Kaye says .
Justin has been profitable since 1986 , adds the official , who shares his office with numerous teddy bears , all samples from his line of plush toys .
Like many others , Mr. Kaye took notice in 1987 when Sony , in a classic example of market segmentation , changed the plastic skin and buttons on the famous Walkman line of portable audio equipment and created the My First Sony line for children .
The brightly colored new products looked more like toys than the adult models .
-LRB- In court papers , Sony says it has spent more than $ 3 million to promote the line , with resulting sales of over a million units . -RRB-
Sony found a new market niche , but Mr. Kaye figured that its prices left plenty of room for a lower - priced competitor .
His products are n't exact copies of Sony 's but strongly resemble them in size , shape and , especially , color .
Sony uses mostly red and blue , with traces of yellow -- and so does Justin , on the theory that kids prefer these colors .
-LRB- `` To be successful , a product can be any color whatsoever , as long as it is fire - engine red , '' says Charles E. Baxley , Justin 's attorney . -RRB-
By last winter , Justin was showing prototypes at toy fairs in Hong Kong and New York -- and Sony noticed .
Indeed , concerned that Sony sales personnel were threatening legal action or other retaliation -- such as withholding desirable Sony products -- against Justin 's customers , Mr. Baxley fired off a letter to Sony in April .
He himself threatened to take the matter to the Federal Trade Commission or U.S. Justice Department .
But Justin has n't pursued those charges -LRB- which were without merit , according to Mr. Eslinger , the Sony attorney -RRB- .
Recalls Mr. Baxley : `` Our purpose was to influence them to leave us alone .
We never intended taking on Sony -- we do n't have the resources . ''
Sony answered the empty threat with its real suit .
Off and on since then , the companies have skirmished in court .
And Justin , in a news release , says , `` Once competitive , Sony now resorts to strong - arm tactics in American courtrooms to carve out and protect niche markets . ''
Sony 's lawyer insists that the company 's tactics -- including the use of a private detective posing as a buyer -- are routine in such matters .
He also insists that Sony , no less than others , has a legal right to protect its `` trade dress , '' in this case , mostly the colors that it claims make My First Sony products distinctive .
-LRB- Justin claims it began using the same colors on electronic goods for children long before Sony entered the children 's market . -RRB-
Whatever its merits , Sony 's aggressive defense is debilitating for Justin .
It 's also costly .
Mr. Kaye says he has paid more than $ 70,000 in legal fees so far .
Of Sony , Mr. Kaye says : `` They know there 's no way for them to lose .
They just keep digging me in deeper until I reach the point where I give up and go away . ''
For now , though , he vows to hang in .
Congress learned during the Reagan administration that it could intimidate the executive branch by uttering again and again the same seven words : `` Provided , that no funds shall be spent ... . ''
This phrase once again is found throughout the many appropriations bills now moving through Congress .
It signals Congress 's attempt , under the pretext of guarding the public purse , to deny the president the funding necessary to execute certain of his duties and prerogatives specified in Article II of the Constitution .
This species of congressional action is predicated on an interpretation of the appropriations clause that is erroneous and unconstitutional .
The appropriations clause states that `` No Money shall be drawn from the Treasury , but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law ... . ''
The prevailing interpretation of the clause on Capitol Hill is that it gives Congress an omnipresent veto over every conceivable action of the president through the ability to withhold funding .
This interpretation was officially endorsed by Congress in 1987 in the Iran - Contra Report .
As partisans of congressional power understand , a `` power of the purse '' so broadly construed would emasculate the presidency and swallow the principle of separation of powers .
It is not supported by the text or history of the Constitution .
The framers hardly discussed the appropriations clause at the Constitutional Convention of 1787 , according to Madison 's notes .
To the extent they did , their concern was to ensure fiscal accountability .
Moreover , the framers believed that the nation needed a unitary executive with the independence and resources to perform the executive functions that the Confederation Congress had performed poorly under the Articles of Confederation .
It would contradict that objective if the appropriations clause -LRB- technically a limitation on legislative power -RRB- could be read as placing the president on Congress 's short leash , making the executive consist of the president and every member of Congress .
As it went to the conference panel now deliberating , the appropriations bill for the executive office of the president for fiscal 1990 contained some breathtaking attempts by Congress to rewrite the Constitution under the pretext of protecting the public 's money .
During the coming weeks , President Bush must decide whether to veto the bills containing them -- or , alternatively , to sign these bills into law with a statement declaring their intrusions on executive power to be in violation of Article II , and thus void and severable .
The 1990 appropriations legislation attempts to strip the president of his powers to make certain appointments as provided by Article II .
Article II places on the president the duty to nominate , `` and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate '' appoint , ambassadors , judges , and other officers of the U.S. .
It also empowers the president to make recess appointments , without Senate approval : `` The President shall have Power to fill up all Vacancies that may happen during the Recess of the Senate , by granting Commissions which shall expire at the End of their next Session . ''
Yet Section 605 of the appropriations bill for the executive office provides : `` No part of any appropriation for the current fiscal year contained in this or any other Act shall be paid to any person for the filling of any position for which he or she has been nominated after the Senate has voted not to approve the nomination of said person . ''
Thus , with one brief passage in an appropriations bill , Congress repeals the president 's power to make recess appointments under Article II .
Section 605 also imposes unconstitutional conditions on the president 's ability to nominate candidates of his choosing .
The language of the appropriations rider implies that any nomination to any position of a rejected nominee will result in the president being denied funding to pay that person 's salary .
The president could probably not avoid this restriction by choosing people willing to serve without pay , because the Anti-Deficiency Act prohibits voluntary service to the government .
The 1990 appropriations bills also contain a number of `` muzzling '' provisions that violate the recommendation clause in Article II of the Constitution .
Muzzling provisions , which might be called `` blindfold laws '' as well , prevent the executive branch from even looking at certain policy options , let alone from recommending them to Congress .
Such laws violate the provision in Article II that requires the president to make recommendations to Congress , but which gives the president the discretion to select the subject matter of those recommendations .
Typically , these laws seek to prevent executive branch officials from inquiring into whether certain federal programs make any economic sense or proposing more market - oriented alternatives to regulations .
Probably the most egregious example is a proviso in the appropriations bill for the executive office that prevents the president 's Office of Management and Budget from subjecting agricultural marketing orders to any cost - benefit scrutiny .
There is something inherently suspect about Congress 's prohibiting the executive from even studying whether public funds are being wasted in some favored program or other .
Perhaps none of the unconstitutional conditions contained in the appropriations bills for fiscal 1990 better illustrates Congress 's attempt to usurp executive power than Section 609 of the executive - office bill : `` None of the funds made available pursuant to the provisions of this Act shall be used to implement , administer , or enforce any regulation which has been disapproved pursuant to a resolution of disapproval duly adopted in accordance with the applicable law of the United States . ''
This provision amounts to a legislative veto over the president 's execution of the law , since a one - house resolution could be said to be `` duly adopted '' even though it would require neither bicameral action in Congress nor presentation to the president for his signature or veto .
The Supreme Court 's decision in INS v. Chadha held that legislative vetoes are unconstitutional .
President Bush should veto appropriations acts that contain these kinds of unconstitutional conditions on the president 's ability to discharge his duties and exercise his prerogatives .
If President Bush fails to do so in his first year , he will invite Congress , for the remainder of his presidency , to rewrite Article II of the Constitution to suit its purposes .
What becomes custom in the Bush administration will only become more difficult for future presidents , including Democrats , to undo .
President Reagan learned that lesson .
By 1987 , then - Speaker Jim Wright was discussing arms control in Moscow with Mikhail Gorbachev and then attempting to direct the president , through an appropriations rider , to treat the Soviets as though the Senate had ratified SALT II .
If a veto is unworkable because it would leave part of the executive branch unfunded , the president could sign the appropriations bills into law and assert a power of excision , declaring the rider restricting his Article II powers to be unconstitutional and severable .
The Constitution does not expressly give the president such power .
However , the president does have a duty not to violate the Constitution .
The question is whether his only means of defense is the veto .
Excision of appropriations riders that trespass on the president 's duties and prerogative under Article II would be different from the line - item veto .
As discussed in the context of controlling federal spending , the line - item veto is characterized as a way for the president to excise perfectly constitutional provisions in a spending bill that are objectionable merely because they conflict with his policy objectives .
The excision of unconstitutional conditions in an appropriations bill would be a power of far more limited applicability .
One could argue that it is not an assertion of a item veto at all for the president , by exerting a power of excision , to resist unconstitutional conditions in legislation that violate the separation of powers .
There is no downside if the president asserts a right of excision over unconstitutional conditions in the fiscal 1990 appropriations bills .
If Congress does nothing , President Bush will have won .
If Congress takes the dispute to the Supreme Court -LRB- assuming it can establish standing to sue -RRB- , President Bush might win .
In that case , he might receive an opinion from the court that is a vindication of the president 's right to perform the duties and exercise the prerogatives the framers thought should be entrusted to the executive .
If President Bush loses at the court , it might be disappointing , as Morrison v. Olson was for the Reagan administration .
But the presidency would be no worse off than it is now .
Moreover , the electorate would have received a valuable civics lesson in how the separation of powers works in practice .
As it stands now , Congress presumes after the Reagan administration that the White House will take unconstitutional provisions in appropriations bills lying down .
President Bush should set things straight .
If he does not , he will help realize Madison 's fear in The Federalist No. 48 of a legislature `` everywhere extending the sphere of its activity and drawing all powers into its impetuous vortex . ''
Mr. Sidak served as an attorney in the Reagan administration .
His longer analysis of executive power and the appropriations clause is to appear in the Duke Law Journal later this year .
FALL BALLOT ISSUES set a record for off - year elections .
Odd - year elections attract relatively few ballot issues .
But the 1989 fall total of 80 , while well below 1988 activity , shows `` a steady ratcheting up in citizen referenda and initiatives , '' says Patrick McGuigan , editor of Family , Law and Democracy Report .
He says the 10 citizen - sparked issues on state ballots this fall represent the most in any odd - year this decade .
Ballot questions range from a Maine initiative on banning Cruise missiles to a referendum on increasing the North Dakota income tax .
Ballot watchers say attention already is focused on the 1990 elections .
In California , two petition drives for next year 's election are `` essentially finished , '' says David Schmidt , author of `` Citizen Lawmakers . ''
Mr. McGuigan cites three completed efforts in Oklahoma .
Hot ballot topics are expected to be abortion , the environment and insurance reform .
Taking a cue from California , more politicians will launch their campaigns by backing initiatives , says David Magleby of Brigham Young University .
PHOTOGRAPH COLLECTING gains new stature as prices rise .
Price records are being set at auctions this week .
At Christie 's , a folio of 21 prints from Alfred Stieglitz 's `` Equivalents '' series sold for $ 396,000 , a single - lot record .
Other works also have been exceeding price estimates .
In part , prices reflect development of a market structure based on such variables as the number of prints .
This information used to be poorly documented and largely anecdotal , says Beth Gates - Warren of Sotheby 's .
`` There is finally some sort of sense in the market , '' she says .
Corporations and museums are among the serious buyers , giving greater market stability , says Robert Persky of the Photograph Collector .
`` When I see prints going into the hands of institutions , I know they are n't going to come back on the market . ''
Most in demand : classic photographs by masters such as Stieglitz and Man Ray .
But much contemporary work is also fetching `` a great deal of money , '' says Miles Barth of the International Center of Photography .
DIALING 900 brings callers a growing number of services .
Currently a $ 300 million - a - year business , 900 telephone service is expected to hit $ 500 million next year and near $ 2 billion by 1992 as uses for the service continue to expand , says Joel Gross of Donaldson , Lufkin & Jenrette Inc .
The service -- which costs the caller from 30 cents to $ 25 a minute -- currently is dominated by celebrity chatter , horoscopes and romance lines .
But more serious applications are in the wings , and that is where the future growth is expected .
`` I 'm starting to see more business transactions , '' says Andrea West of American Telephone & Telegraph Co. , noting growing interest in use of 900 service for stock sales , software tutorials and even service contracts .
Colleges , she says , are eyeing registration through 900 service .
Charities test the waters , but they face legal barriers to electronic fund raising .
`` The thing that will really break this market right open is merchandising , '' Ms. West says .
Much of the 800 service will `` migrate to 900 , '' predicts Jack Lawless , general manager of US Sprint 's 900 product .

DIAPER SERVICES make a comeback amid growing environmental concerns .
Concerned about shrinking landfills and the safety of chemicals used in super-absorbent disposables , parents are returning to the cloth diaper .
Tiny Tots Inc. , Campbell , Calif. , says business is up 35 % in the past year .
`` We 're gaining 1,200 new customers each week , '' says Jack Mogavero of General Health Care Corp. , Piscataway , N.J .
In Syracuse , N.Y. , DyDee Service 's new marketing push stresses environmental awareness .
Among its new customers : day - care centers that previously spurned the service .
The National Association of Diaper Services , Philadelphia , says that since January it has gotten more than 672 inquiries from people interested in starting diaper services .
Elisa Hollis launched a diaper service last year because State College , Pa. , where she lives , did n't have one .
Diaper shortages this summer limited growth at Stork Diaper Services , Springfield , Mass. , where business is up 25 % in
Also spurring the move to cloth : diaper covers with Velcro fasteners that eliminate the need for safety pins .

Program trading is `` a racket , '' complains Edward Egnuss , a White Plains , N.Y. , investor and electronics sales executive , `` and it 's not to the benefit of the small investor , that 's for sure . ''
But although he thinks that it is hurting him , he doubts it could be stopped .
Mr. Egnuss 's dislike of program trading is echoed by many small investors interviewed by Wall Street Journal reporters across the country .
But like Mr. Egnuss , few expect it to be halted entirely , and a surprising number doubt it should be .
`` I think program trading is basically unfair to the individual investor , '' says Leo Fields , a Dallas investor .
He notes that program traders have a commission cost advantage because of the quantity of their trades , that they have a smaller margin requirement than individual investors do and that they often can figure out earlier where the market is heading .
But he blames program trading for only some of the market 's volatility .
He also considers the market overvalued and cites the troubles in junk bonds .
He adds : `` The market may be giving us another message , that a recession is looming . ''
Or , as Dorothy Arighi , an interior decorator in Arnold , Calif. , puts it : `` All kinds of funny things spook the market these days . ''
But she believes that `` program trading creates deviant swings .
It 's not a sound thing ; there 's no inherent virtue in it . ''
She adds that legislation curbing it would be `` a darned good idea . ''
At the Charles Schwab & Co. office in Atlanta 's Buckhead district , a group of investors voices skepticism that federal officials would curb program trading .
Citing the October 1987 crash , Glenn Miller says , `` It 's like the last crash -- they threatened , but no one did anything . ''
A. Donald Anderson , a 59 - year - old Los Angeles investor who says the stock market 's `` fluctuations and gyrations give me the heebie - jeebies , '' does n't see much point in outlawing program trading .
Those who still want to do it `` will just find some way to get around '' any attempt to curb it .
Similarly , Rick Wamre , a 31 - year - old asset manager for a Dallas real - estate firm , would like to see program trading disappear because `` I ca n't see that it does anything for the market or the country . ''
Yet he is n't in favor of new legislation .
`` I think we 've got enough securities laws , '' he says .
`` I 'd much rather see them dealing with interest rates and the deficit . ''
Peter Anthony , who runs an employment agency in New York , decries program trading as `` limiting the game to a few , '' but he also is n't sure it should be more strictly regulated .
`` I do n't want to denounce it because denouncing it would be like denouncing capitalism , '' he explains .
And surprising numbers of small investors seem to be adapting to greater stock market volatility and say they can live with program trading .
Glenn Britta , a 25 - year - old New York financial analyst who plays options for his personal account , says he is `` factoring '' the market 's volatility `` into investment decisions . ''
He adds that program trading `` increases liquidity in the market .
You ca n't hold back technology . ''
And the practice should n't be stopped , he says , because `` even big players are n't immune to the rigors of program trading . ''
Also in New York , Israel Silverman , an insurance - company lawyer , comments that program trading `` increases volatility , but I do n't think it should be banned .
There 's no culprit here .
The market is just becoming more efficient . ''
Arbitraging on differences between spot and futures prices is an important part of many financial markets , he says .
He adds that his shares in a company savings plan are invested in a mutual fund , and volatility , on a given day , may hurt the fund .
But `` I 'm a long - term investor , '' he says .
`` If you were a short - term investor , you might be more leery about program trading . ''
Jim Enzor of Atlanta defends program trading because he believes that it can bring the market back up after a plunge .
`` If we have a real bad day , the program would say , ` Buy , ' '' he explains .
`` If you could get the rhythm of the program trading , you could take advantage of it . ''
What else can a small investor do ?
Scott Taccetta , a Chicago accountant , is going into money - market funds .
Mr. Taccetta says he had just recouped the $ 5,000 he lost in the 1987 crash when he lost more money last Oct. 13 .
Now , he plans to sell all his stocks by the first quarter of 1990 .
In October , before the market dropped , Mrs. Arighi of Arnold , Calif. , moved to sell the `` speculative stocks '' in her family trust `` so we will be able to withstand all this flim - flammery '' caused by program trading .
She believes that the only answer for individuals is to `` buy stocks that 'll weather any storm . ''
Lucille Gorman , an 84 - year - old Chicago housewife , has become amazingly immune to stock - market jolts .
Mrs. Gorman took advantage of low prices after the 1987 crash to buy stocks and has hunted for other bargains since the Oct. 13 plunge .
`` My stocks are all blue chips , '' she says .
`` If the market goes down , I figure it 's paper profits I 'm losing .
On the other hand , if it goes way sky high , I always sell .
You do n't want to get yourself too upset about these things .
Although his team lost the World Series , San Francisco Giants owner Bob Lurie hopes to have a new home for them .
He is an avid fan of a proposition on next week 's ballot to help build a replacement for Candlestick Park .
Small wonder , since he 's asking San Francisco taxpayers to sink up to $ 100 million into the new stadium .
As San Francisco digs out from The Pretty Big One , opponents say the last thing the city can afford is an expensive new stadium .
A stadium craze is sweeping the country .
It 's fueled by the increasing profitability of major - league teams .
Something like one - third of the nation 's 60 largest cities are thinking about new stadiums , ranging from Cleveland to San Antonio and St. Petersburg .
Most boosters claim the new sports complexes will be moneymakers for their city .
Pepperdine University economist Dean Baim scoffs at that .
He has looked at 14 baseball and football stadiums and found that only one -- private Dodger Stadium -- brought more money into a city than it took out .
Stadiums tend to redistribute existing wealth within a community , not create more of it .
Voters generally agree when they are given a chance to decide if they want to sink their own tax dollars into a new mega-stadium .
San Francisco voters rejected a new ballpark two years ago .
Last month , Phoenix voters turned thumbs down on a $ 100 million stadium bond and tax proposition .
Its backers fielded every important interest on their team -- a popular mayor , the Chamber of Commerce , the major media -- and spent $ 100,000 on promotion .
But voters decided that if the stadium was such a good idea someone would build it himself , and rejected it 59 % to 41 % .
In San Francisco , its backers concede the ballpark is at best running even in the polls .
George Christopher , the former San Francisco mayor who built Candlestick Park for the Giants in the 1960s , wo n't endorse the new ballpark .
He says he had Candlestick built because the Giants claimed they needed 10,000 parking spaces .
Since the new park will have only 1,500 spaces , Mr. Christopher thinks backers are playing some fiscal `` games '' of their own with the voters .
Stadium boosters claim that without public money they would never be built .
Miami Dolphins owner Joe Robbie disagrees , and he can prove it .
Several years ago he gave up trying to persuade Miami to improve its city - owned Orange Bowl , and instead built his own $ 100 million coliseum with private funds .
He did n't see why the taxpayers should help build something he would then use to turn a healthy profit .
`` This stadium shows that anything government can do , we can do better , '' Mr. Robbie says .
But to Moon Landrieu , the former New Orleans mayor who helped build that city 's cavernous , money - losing Superdome , questions of who benefits or the bottom line are of little relevance .
`` The Superdome is an exercise in optimism , a statement of faith , '' he has said .
`` It is the very building of it that is important , not how much of it is used or its economics . ''
An Egyptian Pharaoh could n't have justified his pyramids any better .
But civilization has moved forward since then .
Today taxpayers get to vote , most of the time , on whether they want to finance the building schemes of our modern political pharaohs , or let private money erect these playgrounds for public passions .
A man from the Bush administration came before the House Agriculture Committee yesterday to talk about the U.S. 's intention to send some $ 100 million in food aid to Poland , with more to come from the EC .
The committee 's members are worried what all this free food might do to the economic prospects of Poland 's own farmers .
Rep. Gary Ackerman noted that past food aid had harmed farmers in El Salvador and Egypt .
However well intentioned , food transfers have the habit of growing larger and wrecking the market incentives for the recipient country 's own farmers .
The First World has for some time had the bad habit of smothering other people 's economies with this kind of unfocused kindness .
It should be constantly stressed that Poland 's farmers mostly need a real market for their products .
ORTEGA ENDED a truce with the Contras and said elections were threatened .
The Nicaraguan president , citing attacks by the U.S. - backed rebels , suspended a 19 - month - old cease - fire and accused Bush of `` promoting death . ''
While he reaffirmed support for the country 's Feb. 25 elections , Ortega indicated that renewed U.S. military aid to the Contras could thwart the balloting .
He said U.S. assistance should be used to demobilize the rebels .
A White House spokesman condemned the truce suspension as `` deplorable '' but brushed off talk of renewing military funding for the insurgents .
The Contra military command , in a statement from Honduras , said Sandinista troops had launched a major offensive against the rebel forces .
East German leader Krenz called the protests in his country a `` good sign , '' saying that many of those marching for democratic freedoms were showing support for `` the renovation for socialism . ''
The Communist Party chief , in Moscow for talks with Soviet officials , also said East Germany would follow Gorbachev 's restructuring plans .
Thousands of East Germans fled to Czechoslovakia after the East Berlin government lifted travel restrictions .
The ban on cross-border movement was imposed last month after a massive exodus of emigres to West Germany .
Also , a Communist official for the first time said the future of the Berlin Wall could be open to discussion .
Health officials plan to extend a moratorium on federal funding of research involving fetal - tissue transplants .
The assistant HHS secretary said the ban `` should be continued indefinitely . ''
While researchers believe such transplants could help treat diseases like Alzheimer 's , anti-abortionists oppose the research .
Rep. Dingell of Michigan plans to unveil today a proposal that would break with Bush 's clean - air bill on the issue of emissions that lead to acid rain .
The Democrat 's proposal is described by government sources and lobbyists as significantly weaker than the president 's plan to cut utility emissions .
House - Senate conferees approved major portions of a package for more than $ 500 million in economic aid for Poland .
The plan relies heavily on $ 240 million in credit and loan guarantees in fiscal 1990 in hopes of stimulating future trade and investment .
South Africa accused armed Namibian nationalist guerrillas of crossing from bases in neighboring Angola , violating U.N. - supervised peace plans for the territory 's independence from Pretoria .
South African troops were placed on alert .
Guerrilla leaders said Pretoria was attempting to sabotage next week 's elections in Namibia .
Gunmen in Lebanon assassinated a Saudi Arabian Embassy employee , and the pro-Iranian Islamic Jihad took responsibility for the slaying to avenge the beheading of 16 terrorists by Riyadh 's government in September .
Also in Beirut , a Moslem group vowed to kill Americans if the U.S. implements a policy to seize suspects abroad .
Nixon concluded five days of private talks with Chinese leaders in Beijing , but apparently failed to ease strains in Sino - U.S. ties caused by China 's crackdown against pro-democracy protesters in June .
Beijing 's rulers complained to the former president about U.S. `` interference '' in China 's domestic affairs .
Mexico 's President Salinas said the country 's recession had ended and the economy was growing again .

Beauty Takes Backseat To Safety on Bridges
EVERYONE AGREES that most of the nation 's old bridges need to be repaired or replaced .
But there 's disagreement over how to do it .
Highway officials insist the ornamental railings on older bridges are n't strong enough to prevent vehicles from crashing through .
But other people do n't want to lose the bridges ' beautiful , sometimes historic , features .
`` The primary purpose of a railing is to contain a vehicle and not to provide a scenic view , '' says Jack White , a planner with the Indiana Highway Department .
He and others prefer to install railings such as the `` type F safety shape , '' a four - foot - high concrete slab with no openings .
In Richmond , Ind. , the type F railing is being used to replace arched openings on the G Street Bridge .
Garret Boone , who teaches art at Earlham College , calls the new structure `` just an ugly bridge '' and one that blocks the view of a new park below .
In Hartford , Conn. , the Charter Oak Bridge will soon be replaced , the cast - iron medallions from its railings relegated to a park .
Compromises are possible .
Citizens in Peninsula , Ohio , upset over changes to a bridge , negotiated a deal : The bottom half of the railing will be type F , while the top half will have the old bridge 's floral pattern .
Similarly , highway engineers agreed to keep the old railings on the Key Bridge in Washington , D.C. , as long as they could install a crash barrier between the sidewalk and the road .
Tray Bon ?
Drink Carrier Competes With Cartons
PORTING POTABLES just got easier , or so claims Scypher Corp. , the maker of the Cup - Tote .
The Chicago company 's beverage carrier , meant to replace cardboard trays at concession stands and fast - food outlets , resembles the plastic loops used on six - packs of beer , only the loops hang from a web of strings .
The new carrier can tote as many as four cups at once .
Inventor Claire Marvin says his design virtually eliminates spilling .
Lids are n't even needed .
He also claims the carrier costs less and takes up less space than most paper carriers .
A few fast - food outlets are giving it a try .
The company acknowledges some problems .
A driver has to find something to hang the carrier on , so the company supplies a window hook .
While it breaks down in prolonged sunlight , it is n't recyclable .
And unlike some trays , there 's no place for food .
Spirit of Perestroika Touches Design World
AN EXCHANGE of U.S. and Soviet designers promises change on both sides .
An exhibition of American design and architecture opened in September in Moscow and will travel to eight other Soviet cities .
The show runs the gamut , from a blender to chairs to a model of the Citicorp building .
The event continues into next year and includes an exchange program to swap design teachers at Carnegie - Mellon and Leningrad 's Mutchin Institute .
Dan Droz , leader of the Carnegie - Mellon group , sees benefits all around .
The Soviets , who normally have few clients other than the state , will get `` exposure to a market system , '' he says .
Americans will learn more about making products for the Soviets .
Mr. Droz says the Soviets could even help U.S. designers renew their sense of purpose .
`` In Moscow , they kept asking us things like , ` Why do you make 15 different corkscrews , when all you need is one good one ? ' '' he says .
`` They got us thinking maybe we should be helping U.S. companies improve existing products rather than always developing new ones . ''
Seed for Jail Solution Fails to Take Root
IT 'S A TWO BIRDS with one stone deal : Eggers Group architects propose using grain elevators to house prisoners .
It would ease jail overcrowding while preserving historic structures , the company says .
But New York state , which is seeking solutions to its prison cell shortage , says `` no . ''
Grain elevators built in the 1920s and '30s have six - inch concrete walls and a tubular shape that would easily contain semicircular cells with a control point in the middle , the New York firm says .
Many are far enough from residential areas to pass public muster , yet close enough to permit family visits .
Besides , Eggers says , grain elevators are worth preserving for aesthetic reasons -- one famed architect compared them to the pyramids of Egypt .
A number of cities -- including Minneapolis , Philadelphia and Houston -- have vacant grain elevators , Eggers says .
A medium - sized one in Brooklyn , it says , could be altered to house up to 1,000 inmates at a lower cost than building a new prison in upstate New York .
A spokesman for the state , however , calls the idea `` not effective or cost efficient .

The art of change - ringing is peculiar to the English , and , like most English peculiarities , unintelligible to the rest of the world .
-- Dorothy L. Sayers , `` The Nine Tailors ''
ASLACTON , England
-- Of all scenes that evoke rural England , this is one of the loveliest : An ancient stone church stands amid the fields , the sound of bells cascading from its tower , calling the faithful to evensong .
The parishioners of St. Michael and All Angels stop to chat at the church door , as members here always have .
In the tower , five men and women pull rhythmically on ropes attached to the same five bells that first sounded here in 1614 .
But there is also a discordant , modern note in Aslacton , though it ca n't be heard by the church - goers enjoying the peal of bells this cool autumn evening .
Like most of the other 6,000 churches in Britain with sets of bells , St. Michael once had its own `` band '' of ringers , who would herald every Sunday morning and evening service .
Now , only one local ringer remains : 64 - year - old Derek Hammond .
The others here today live elsewhere .
They belong to a group of 15 ringers -- including two octogenarians and four youngsters in training -- who drive every Sunday from church to church in a sometimes - exhausting effort to keep the bells sounding in the many belfries of East Anglia .
`` To ring for even one service at this tower , we have to scrape , '' says Mr. Hammond , a retired water - authority worker .
`` We 've tried to train the youngsters , but they have their discos and their dances , and they just drift away . ''
Mr. Hammond worries that old age and the flightiness of youth will diminish the ranks of the East Anglian group that keeps the Aslacton bells pealing .
History , after all , is not on his side .
According to a nationwide survey taken a year ago , nearly a third of England 's church bells are no longer rung on Sundays because there is no one to ring them .
It is easy to see why the ancient art is on the ropes .
The less complicated version of playing tunes on bells , as do the carillons of continental Europe , is considered by the English to be childish , fit only for foreigners .
Change - ringing , a mind - boggling exercise the English invented 380 years ago , requires physical dexterity -- some bells weigh more than a ton -- combined with intense mental concentration .
Proper English bells are started off in `` rounds , '' from the highest - pitched bell to the lowest -- a simple descending scale using , in larger churches , as many as 12 bells .
Then , at a signal , the ringers begin varying the order in which the bells sound without altering the steady rhythm of the striking .
Each variation , or change , can occur only once , the rules state .
Ringers memorize patterns of changes , known as `` methods , '' which have odd - sounding names like Kent Treble Bob Major or Grandsire Caters .
A series of 5,000 or so changes is a `` peal '' and takes about three hours .
A look at a Thursday night practice at St. Mary Abbot church in the Kensington district of London gives an idea of the work involved .
Ten shirt - sleeved ringers stand in a circle , one foot ahead of the other in a prize - fighter 's stance , each pulling a rope that disappears through a small hole in the high ceiling of the ringing chamber .
No one speaks , and the snaking of the ropes seems to make as much sound as the bells themselves , muffled by the ceiling .
Totally absorbed , the ringers stare straight ahead , using peripheral vision -LRB- they call it `` rope - sight '' -RRB- to watch the other ropes and thus time their pulls .
Far above in the belfry , the huge bronze bells , mounted on wheels , swing madly through a full 360 degrees , starting and ending , surprisingly , in the inverted , or mouth - up position .
Skilled ringers use their wrists to advance or retard the next swing , so that one bell can swap places with another in the following change .
In a well - known detective - story involving church bells , English novelist Dorothy L. Sayers described ringing as a `` passion -LCB- that -RCB- finds its satisfaction in mathematical completeness and mechanical perfection . ''
Ringers , she added , are `` filled with the solemn intoxication that comes of intricate ritual faultlessly performed . ''
`` Ringing does become a bit of an obsession , '' admits Stephanie Pattenden , master of the band at St. Mary Abbot and one of England 's best female ringers .
It is a passion that usually stays in the tower , however .
More often than not , ringers think of the church as something stuck on the bottom of the belfry .
When their changes are completed , and after they have worked up a sweat , ringers often skip off to the local pub , leaving worship for others below .
This does not sit well with some clerics .
With membership of the Church of England steadily dwindling , strong - willed vicars are pressing equally strong - willed and often non-religious ringers to attend services .
Two years ago , the Rev. Jeremy Hummerstone , vicar of Great Torrington , Devon , got so fed up with ringers who did n't attend service he sacked the entire band ; the ringers promptly set up a picket line in protest .
`` They were a self - perpetuating club that treated the tower as sort of a separate premises , '' the Vicar Hummerstone says .
An entirely new band rings today at Great Torrington , several of whom are members of the congregation .
But there still are n't enough ringers to ring more than six of the eight bells .
At St. Mary 's Church in Ilminster , Somerset , the bells have fallen silent following a dust - up over church attendance .
The vicar , W.D. Jones , refuses to talk about it , saying it would `` reopen the wound . ''
But C.J.B. Marshall , vicar of a nearby church , feels the fault is in the stairs from the bell tower that are located next to the altar .
`` So crunch , crunch , crunch , bang , bang , bang -- here come the ringers from above , making a very obvious exit while the congregation is at prayer , '' he says .
Vicar Marshall admits to mixed feelings about this issue , since he is both a vicar and an active bell - ringer himself .
`` The sound of bells is a net to draw people into the church , '' he says .
`` I live in hopes that the ringers themselves will be drawn into that fuller life . ''
The Central Council of Church Bell Ringers , a sort of parliament of ringing groups , aims to improve relations with vicars , says John C. Baldwin , president .
It hopes to speak to students at theological colleges about the joys of bell ringing and will shortly publish a booklet for every vicar in the country entitled , `` The Bells in Your Care . ''
Says Mr. Baldwin , `` We recognize that we may no longer have as high a priority in church life and experience . ''
Mr. Baldwin is also attacking the greater problem : lack of ringers .
One survey says that of the 100,000 trained bellringers in England today , only 40,000 of them still ring .
Also , ringers do n't always live where the bells need to be rung -- like in small , rural parishes and inner - city churches .
But the council 's program to attract and train ringers is only partly successful , says Mr. Baldwin .
`` Right now , we 're lucky if after five years we keep one new ringer out of 10 , '' he adds .
One bright sign is that a growing number of women have entered the once male - dominated field ; more than a third of the ringers today are women .
They are n't accepted everywhere , however .
The oldest bell - ringing group in the country , the Ancient Society of College Youths , founded in 1637 , remains male - only , a fact that 's particularly galling to women because the group is the sole source of ringers for Britain 's most prestigious churches , St. Paul 's Cathedral and Westminster Abbey .
This being Britain , no woman has filed an equal - opportunity suit , but the extent of the problem surfaced this summer in a series of letters to `` The Ringing World , '' a weekly newspaper for ringers .
One writer , signing his letter as `` Red - blooded , balanced male , '' remarked on the `` frequency of women fainting in peals , '' and suggested that they `` settle back into their traditional role of making tea at meetings . ''
In the torrent of replies that followed , one woman ringer from Solihull observed that `` the average male ringer leaves quite a lot to be desired : badly dressed , decorated with acne and a large beer - belly , frequently unwashed and unbearably flatulent in peals . ''
Another women wrote from Sheffield to say that in her 60 years of ringing , `` I have never known a lady to faint in the belfry .
I have seen one or two men die , bless them .
The U.S. , claiming some success in its trade diplomacy , removed South Korea , Taiwan and Saudi Arabia from a list of countries it is closely watching for allegedly failing to honor U.S. patents , copyrights and other intellectual - property rights .
However , five other countries -- China , Thailand , India , Brazil and Mexico -- will remain on that so - called priority watch list as a result of an interim review , U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills announced .
Under the new U.S. trade law , those countries could face accelerated unfair - trade investigations and stiff trade sanctions if they do n't improve their protection of intellectual property by next spring .
Mrs. Hills said many of the 25 countries that she placed under varying degrees of scrutiny have made `` genuine progress '' on this touchy issue .
She said there is `` growing realization '' around the world that denial of intellectual - property rights harms all trading nations , and particularly the `` creativity and inventiveness of an -LCB- offending -RCB- country 's own citizens . ''
U.S. trade negotiators argue that countries with inadequate protections for intellectual - property rights could be hurting themselves by discouraging their own scientists and authors and by deterring U.S. high - technology firms from investing or marketing their best products there .
Mrs. Hills lauded South Korea for creating an intellectual - property task force and special enforcement teams of police officers and prosecutors trained to pursue movie and book pirates .
Seoul also has instituted effective search - and - seizure procedures to aid these teams , she said .
Taiwan has improved its standing with the U.S. by initialing a bilateral copyright agreement , amending its trademark law and introducing legislation to protect foreign movie producers from unauthorized showings of their films .
That measure could compel Taipei 's growing number of small video - viewing parlors to pay movie producers for showing their films .
Saudi Arabia , for its part , has vowed to enact a copyright law compatible with international standards and to apply the law to computer software as well as to literary works , Mrs. Hills said .
These three countries are n't completely off the hook , though .
They will remain on a lower - priority list that includes 17 other countries .
Those countries -- including Japan , Italy , Canada , Greece and Spain -- are still of some concern to the U.S. but are deemed to pose less - serious problems for American patent and copyright owners than those on the `` priority '' list .
Gary Hoffman , a Washington lawyer specializing in intellectual - property cases , said the threat of U.S. retaliation , combined with a growing recognition that protecting intellectual property is in a country 's own interest , prompted the improvements made by South Korea , Taiwan and Saudi Arabia .
`` What this tells us is that U.S. trade law is working , '' he said .
He said Mexico could be one of the next countries to be removed from the priority list because of its efforts to craft a new patent law .
Mrs. Hills said that the U.S. is still concerned about `` disturbing developments in Turkey and continuing slow progress in Malaysia . ''
She did n't elaborate , although earlier U.S. trade reports have complained of videocassette piracy in Malaysia and disregard for U.S. pharmaceutical patents in Turkey .
The 1988 trade act requires Mrs. Hills to issue another review of the performance of these countries by April 30 .
So far , Mrs. Hills has n't deemed any cases bad enough to merit an accelerated investigation under the so - called special 301 provision of the act .
Judging from the Americana in Haruki Murakami 's `` A Wild Sheep Chase '' -LRB- Kodansha , 320 pages , $ 18.95 -RRB- , baby boomers on both sides of the Pacific have a lot in common .
Although set in Japan , the novel 's texture is almost entirely Western , especially American .
Characters drink Salty Dogs , whistle `` Johnny B. Goode '' and watch Bugs Bunny reruns .
They read Mickey Spillane and talk about Groucho and Harpo .
They worry about their careers , drink too much and suffer through broken marriages and desultory affairs .
This is Japan ?
For an American reader , part of the charm of this engaging novel should come in recognizing that Japan is n't the buttoned - down society of contemporary American lore .
It 's also refreshing to read a Japanese author who clearly does n't belong to the self - aggrandizing `` we - Japanese '' school of writers who perpetuate the notion of the unique Japanese , unfathomable by outsiders .
If `` A Wild Sheep Chase '' carries an implicit message for international relations , it 's that the Japanese are more like us than most of us think .
That 's not to say that the nutty plot of `` A Wild Sheep Chase '' is rooted in reality .
It 's imaginative and often funny .
A disaffected , hard - drinking , nearly - 30 hero sets off for snow country in search of an elusive sheep with a star on its back at the behest of a sinister , erudite mobster with a Stanford degree .
He has in tow his prescient girlfriend , whose sassy retorts mark her as anything but a docile butterfly .
Along the way , he meets a solicitous Christian chauffeur who offers the hero God 's phone number ; and the Sheep Man , a sweet , roughhewn figure who wears -- what else -- a sheepskin .
The 40 - year - old Mr. Murakami is a publishing sensation in Japan .
A more recent novel , `` Norwegian Wood '' -LRB- every Japanese under 40 seems to be fluent in Beatles lyrics -RRB- , has sold more than four million copies since Kodansha published it in 1987 .
But he is just one of several youthful writers -- Tokyo 's brat pack -- who are dominating the best - seller charts in Japan .
Their books are written in idiomatic , contemporary language and usually carry hefty dashes of Americana .
In Robert Whiting 's `` You Gotta Have Wa '' -LRB- Macmillan , 339 pages , $ 17.95 -RRB- , the Beatles give way to baseball , in the Nipponese version we would be hard put to call a `` game . ''
As Mr. Whiting describes it , Nipponese baseball is a `` mirror of Japan 's fabled virtues of hard work and harmony . ''
`` Wa '' is Japanese for `` team spirit '' and Japanese ballplayers have miles and miles of it .
A player 's commitment to practice and team image is as important as his batting average .
Polls once named Tokyo Giants star Tatsunori Hara , a `` humble , uncomplaining , obedient soul , '' as the male symbol of Japan .
But other than the fact that besuboru is played with a ball and a bat , it 's unrecognizable : Fans politely return foul balls to stadium ushers ; the strike zone expands depending on the size of the hitter ; ties are permitted -- even welcomed -- since they honorably sidestep the shame of defeat ; players must abide by strict rules of conduct even in their personal lives -- players for the Tokyo Giants , for example , must always wear ties when on the road .
`` You Gotta Have Wa '' is the often amusing chronicle of how American ballplayers , rationed to two per team , fare in Japan .
Despite the enormous sums of money they 're paid to stand up at a Japanese plate , a good number decide it 's not worth it and run for home .
`` Funny Business '' -LRB- Soho , 228 pages , $ 17.95 -RRB- by Gary Katzenstein is anything but .
It 's the petulant complaint of an impudent American whom Sony hosted for a year while he was on a Luce Fellowship in Tokyo -- to the regret of both parties .
In sometimes amusing , more often supercilious , even vicious passages , Mr. Katzenstein describes how Sony invades even the most mundane aspects of its workers ' lives -- at the regimented office , where employees are assigned lunch partners -- and at `` home '' in the austere company dormitory run by a prying caretaker .
Some of his observations about Japanese management style are on the mark .
It 's probably true that many salarymen put in unproductive overtime just for the sake of solidarity , that the system is so hierarchical that only the assistant manager can talk to the manager and the manager to the general manager , and that Sony was chary of letting a young , short - term American employee take on any responsibility .
All of this must have been enormously frustrating to Mr. Katzenstein , who went to Sony with degrees in business and computer science and was raring to invent another Walkman .
But Sony ultimately took a lesson from the American management books and fired Mr. Katzenstein , after he committed the social crime of making an appointment to see the venerable Akio Morita , founder of Sony .
It 's a shame their meeting never took place .
Mr. Katzenstein certainly would have learned something , and it 's even possible Mr. Morita would have too .

More and more corners of the globe are becoming free of tobacco smoke .
In Singapore , a new law requires smokers to put out their cigarettes before entering restaurants , department stores and sports centers or face a $ 250 fine .
Discos and private clubs are exempt from the ban , and smoking will be permitted in bars except during meal hours , an official said .
Singapore already bans smoking in all theaters , buses , public elevators , hospitals and fast - food restaurants .
In Malaysia , Siti Zaharah Sulaiman , a deputy minister in the prime minister 's office , launched a `` No - Smoking Week '' at the Mara Institute of Technology near Kuala Lumpur and urged other schools to ban on - campus smoking .
South Korea has different concerns .
In Seoul , officials began visiting about 26,000 cigarette stalls to remove illegal posters and signboards advertising imported cigarettes .
South Korea has opened its market to foreign cigarettes but restricts advertising to designated places .
A marketing study indicates that Hong Kong consumers are the most materialistic in the 14 major markets where the survey was carried out .
The study by the Backer Spielvogel Bates ad agency also found that the colony 's consumers feel more pressured than those in any of the other surveyed markets , which include the U.S. and Japan .
The survey found that nearly half of Hong Kong consumers espouse what it identified as materialistic values , compared with about one - third in Japan and the U.S. .
More than three in five said they are under a great deal of stress most of the time , compared with less than one in two U.S. consumers and one in four in Japan .
The Thai cabinet endorsed Finance Minister Pramual Sabhavasu 's proposal to build a $ 19 million conference center for a joint meeting of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund two years from now .
The meeting , which is expected to draw 20,000 to Bangkok , was going to be held at the Central Plaza Hotel , but the government balked at the hotel 's conditions for undertaking necessary expansion .
A major concern about the current plan is whether the new center can be built in such a short time .
Yasser Arafat has written to the chairman of the International Olympic Committee asking him to back a Palestinian bid to join the committee , the Palestine Liberation Organization news agency WAFA said .

The PLO in recent months has been trying to join international organizations but failed earlier this year to win membership in the World Health Organization and the World Tourism Organization .

The man had for a long time had `` a chaotic sex life , '' including relations with foreign men , the newspaper said .
The Polish government increased home electricity charges by 150 % and doubled gas prices .
The official news agency PAP said the increases were intended to bring unrealistically low energy charges into line with production costs and compensate for a rise in coal prices .

In a victory for environmentalists , Hungary 's parliament terminated a multibillion - dollar River Danube dam being built by Austrian firms .
The Nagymaros dam was designed to be twinned with another dam , now nearly complete , 100 miles upstream in Czechoslovakia .
In ending Hungary 's part of the project , Parliament authorized Prime Minister Miklos Nemeth to modify a 1977 agreement with Czechoslovakia , which still wants the dam to be built .
Mr. Nemeth said in parliament that Czechoslovakia and Hungary would suffer environmental damage if the twin dams were built as planned .
Czechoslovakia said in May it could seek $ 2 billion from Hungary if the twindam contract were broken .
The Czech dam ca n't be operated solely at peak periods without the Nagymaros project .

The Internal Revenue Service has threatened criminal sanctions against lawyers who fail to report detailed information about clients who pay them more than $ 10,000 in cash .
The warnings , issued to at least 100 criminal defense attorneys in several major cities in the last week , have led to an outcry by members of the organized bar , who claim the information is protected by attorney - client privilege .
The IRS warnings stem from a 1984 law that requires anyone who receives more than $ 10,000 in cash from a client or customer in one or more related transactions `` in the course of trade or business '' to report the payment on a document known as Form 8300 .
The form asks for such details as the client 's name , Social Security number , passport number and details about the services provided for the payment .
Failure to complete the form had been punishable as a misdemeanor until last November , when Congress determined that the crime was a felony punishable by up to 10 years in prison .
Attorneys have argued since 1985 , when the law took effect , that they can not provide information about clients who do n't wish their identities to be known .
Many attorneys have returned incomplete forms to the IRS in recent years , citing attorney - client privilege .
Until last week , the IRS rarely acted on the incomplete forms .
`` This form forces a lawyer to become , in effect , a witness against his client , '' said Neal R. Sonnett , president of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers .
`` The IRS is asking lawyers to red - flag a criminal problem to the government , '' added Mr. Sonnett , a Miami lawyer who has heard from dozens of attorneys who received letters in recent days and has himself received the computer - generated IRS forms sent by certified mail .
Mr. Sonnett said that clients who pay cash may include alleged drug dealers who do n't have domestic bank accounts .
These individuals may not necessarily be under investigation when they hire lawyers .
Mr. Sonnett said there also may be other circumstances under which individuals would n't want the government to know they had retained criminal defense lawyers .
Filling out detailed forms about these individuals would tip the IRS off and spark action against the clients , he said .
The defense lawyers ' group formed a task force this week , chaired by New York attorney Gerald Lefcourt , to deal with the matter .
The American Bar Association 's House of Delegates passed a resolution in 1985 condemning the IRS reporting requirement .
Michael Ross , a New York lawyer who heads the ABA 's grand jury committee , said that lawyers are prohibited by the ABA 's code of ethics from disclosing information about a client except where a court orders it or to prevent the client from committing a criminal act that could result in death .
Mr. Ross said he met with officials of the IRS and the Justice Department , which would bring any enforcement actions against taxpayers , to discuss the issue last May .
At that meeting , he said , the Justice Department assured him that enforcement procedures would n't be threatened against attorneys without further review and advance notice .
Mr. Ross said IRS officials opposed the Justice Department 's moderate stance on the matter .
But in the letters sent in recent days , Christopher J. Lezovich of the IRS computing center in Detroit , told attorneys that `` failing to voluntarily submit the requested information could result in summons enforcement action being initiated . ''
In some cases , the IRS asked for information dating back to forms it received in 1985 .
A spokesman for the IRS confirmed that `` there has been correspondence mailed about incomplete 8300s , '' but he declined to say why the letters were sent to lawyers now .
Individuals familiar with the Justice Department 's policy said that Justice officials had n't any knowledge of the IRS 's actions in the last week .
Lawyers worry that if they provide information about clients , that data could quickly end up in the hands of prosecutors .
Prosecutors need court permission to obtain the tax returns of an individual or a business .
But they have obtained 8300 forms without court permission and used the information to help develop criminal cases .
Some criminal lawyers speculated that the IRS was sending the letters to test the issue .
In a number of recent cases , federal courts have refused to recognize attorneys ' assertions that information relating to fees from clients should be confidential .
THE WAR OVER FEDERAL JUDICIAL SALARIES takes a victim .
Often , judges ease into more lucrative private practice with little fanfare , but not federal Judge Raul A. Ramirez in Sacramento , Calif .
On Tuesday , the judge called a news conference to say he was quitting effective Dec. 31 to join a San Francisco law firm .
The reason : the refusal of Congress to give federal judges a raise .
`` A couple of my law clerks were going to pass me in three or four years , and I was afraid I was going to have to ask them for a loan , '' the judge quipped in an interview .
Federal judges make $ 89,500 annually ; in February , Congress rejected a bill that would have increased their pay by 50 % .
Judge Ramirez , 44 , said it is unjust for judges to make what they do .
`` Judges are not getting what they deserve .
You look around at professional ballplayers or accountants ... and nobody blinks an eye .
When you become a federal judge , all of a sudden you are relegated to a paltry sum . ''
At his new job , as partner in charge of federal litigation in the Sacramento office of Orrick , Herrington & Sutcliffe , he will make out much better .
The judge declined to discuss his salary in detail , but said : `` I 'm going to be a high - priced lawyer . ''
DOONESBURY CREATOR'S UNION TROUBLES are no laughing matter .
Cartoonist Garry Trudeau is suing the Writers Guild of America East for $ 11 million , alleging it mounted a `` campaign to harass and punish '' him for crossing a screenwriters ' picket line .
The dispute involves Darkhorse Productions Inc. , a TV production company in which Mr. Trudeau is a co-owner .
Mr. Trudeau , a Writers Guild member , also was employed as a writer for Darkhorse , which was covered by a guild collective - bargaining agreement .
The guild began a strike against the TV and movie industry in March 1988 .
In his lawsuit , Mr. Trudeau says the strike illegally included Darkhorse , and the cartoonist refused to honor the strike against the company .
A spokesman for the guild said the union 's lawyers are reviewing the suit .
He said disciplinary proceedings are confidential and declined to comment on whether any are being held against Mr. Trudeau .
Mr. Trudeau 's attorney , Norman K. Samnick , said the harassment consists mainly of the guild 's year - long threats of disciplinary action .
Mr. Samnick said a guild disciplinary hearing is scheduled next Monday in New York .
Mr. Samnick , who will go before the disciplinary panel , said the proceedings are unfair and that any punishment from the guild would be unjustified .
In addition to the damages , the suit seeks a court order preventing the guild from punishing or retaliating against Mr. Trudeau .
ABORTION RULING UPHELD :
A federal appeals court upheld a lower court ruling that the U.S. can bar the use of federal funds for family - planning programs that include abortion - related services .
A Department of Health and Human Services rule adopted in 1988 prohibits the use of so - called Title X funds for programs that assist a woman in obtaining an abortion , such as abortion counseling and referrals .
The rule also prohibits funding for activities that `` encourage , promote or advocate abortion . ''
Title X funds are the single largest source of federal funding for family - planning services , according to the opinion by the Second U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York .
The panel ruled that the restrictions do n't violate the freedom of speech of health care providers and that the limits on counseling services do n't violate the rights of pregnant women .
INQUIRY CLEARS TEXAS JUDGE of bias in comments on homosexual murder victims .
Dallas District Judge Jack Hampton had sparked calls for a judicial inquiry with his remarks to the press last December , two weeks after sentencing an 18 - year - old defendant to 30 years in state prison for killing two homosexual men in a city park .
The judge was quoted as referring to the victims as `` queers '' and saying they would n't have been killed `` if they had n't been cruising the streets picking up teenage boys . ''
But Robert R. Murray , a special master appointed by the Texas Supreme Court , said Judge Hampton did n't breach any judicial standards of fairness , although he did violate the state 's judicial code by commenting publicly on a pending case .
Observing that the judge `` has never exhibited any bias or prejudice , '' Mr. Murray concluded that he `` would be impartial in any case involving a homosexual or prostitute '' as a victim .
Mr. Murray also said Judge Hampton 's comments did n't discredit the judiciary or the administration of justice .
The report is subject to review by the State Commission on Judicial Conduct , which is empowered to impose sanctions .
GAF TRIAL goes to round three .
Attorneys in the third stock - manipulation trial of GAF Corp. began opening arguments yesterday in the Manhattan courtroom of U.S. District Judge Mary Johnson Lowe .
In an eight - count indictment , the government has charged GAF , a Wayne , N.J. , specialty chemical maker , and its Vice Chairman James T. Sherwin with attempting to manipulate the common stock of Union Carbide Corp. in advance of GAF 's planned sale of a large block of the stock in November 1986 .
The first two GAF trials ended in mistrials earlier this year .
This trial is expected to last five weeks .
SWITCHING TO THE DEFENSE :

He will specialize in white - collar criminal defense work .

Jiaju Hou , a Taiwan economist , published an article with the title " Three comments on ' do n't rush , be patient ' " in Taiwan 's " Daily Economy " on Monday , pointing out that Taiwan authorities ' adopting a " do n't rush , be patient " restriction policy for Taiwan businessmen investing in our country 's mainland would give rise to many abuses .
Jiaju Hou points out that Taiwan authorities say that " do n't rush , be patient " is to restrict large - sized Taiwan companies from going to China 's mainland to invest and would have no impact on medium - and small - sized companies , but this is actually not the case .
Currently , Taiwan authorities define medium - and small - sized companies as having capital of under 60 million Taiwan dollars , but actually Taiwan 's current medium - and small - sized companies mostly have significant scale .
Taking medium and small - sized companies listed last year as top ten for example , the smallest net operating revenue of these was 3.365 billion Taiwan dollars , the highest reached 10 billion Taiwan dollars .
Obviously , implementing a " do n't rush , be patient " policy will result in losing many business opportunities in our country 's mainland for no reason .
Jiaju Hou believed that the " do n't rush , be patient " policy would also have influence on exports to our country 's mainland .
Because , among exports from Taiwan to our country 's mainland , a large portion are due to Taiwan businessmen investing in setting up factories in our country 's mainland and needing to ship spare parts for machines and equipment and intermediate raw materials .
In recent years , Taiwan 's trade surplus with our country 's mainland has accumulatively reached 80 billion US dollars , which is almost the same as Taiwan 's foreign currency reserve .
While the financial storm shows no sign of relief today , the importance of this surplus is more and more obvious .
How can Taiwan decrease exports to our country 's mainland for the sake of " do n't rush , be patient " ?
Because this will reduce its trade surplus with our country 's mainland .
Jiaju Hou pointed out that the " do n't rush , be patient " policy would also restrain foreign businessmen from investing in Taiwan .
Because most foreign businessmen investing in Taiwan want to take this opportunity to jointly invest in our country 's mainland with Taiwan investments .
Therefore , this policy , while blocking the development of local enterprises , will also limit foreign businessmen 's wishes to invest in Taiwan .
It is reported that Jiaju Hou has successively published 3 articles in Taiwan newspapers on the " do n't rush , be patient " policy , pointing out to Taiwan authorities that this erroneous mainland economic and trade policy violates the " basic philosophy of free economy " , and hopes that Taiwan authorities " are warned of the consequences " .

" Five years ago , when China 's digital telephone program - controlled switch market was monopolized by various brands of foreign products , we worried about whether China could successfully develop digital program - controlled switches .
Today , domestically produced high - performance telephone program - controlled telephone switches already account for 36 % of the domestic market share . "
" When China 's National Meteorological Bureau bought mainframe computers from Cray Inc. of the U.S. , it just sold us two processors .
Today , the maximum computing speed of the ' Dawn 1000 ' computer we developed ourselves has already reached 2.5 billion operations per second , exceeding the speed of the computer sold to us by Cray Inc. "
This is part of the speech delivered at the working meeting of the " 863 Program " today by Jian Song , State council member and concurrently director of the National Science Commission .
The " 863 Program " is China 's high - tech research program , initiated in 1986 .
Western developed countries have always restricted the export of important high - tech products , such as high - performance large - scale digital telephone program - controlled switches and supercomputers , to China .
Jian Song said that " Today , China is capable of producing more than 10,000 sets of digital telephone program - controlled switches , and the chief designer of this kind of switch is only 28 years old , graduating from Wuhan University . "
Most of the research staff who successfully developed the ' Dawning 1000 ' computer last year are young people about 30 years old .
Today , Jian Song said to hundreds of high - tech experts representatives and science and technology officials attending the meeting : " The series of achievements we have made in the development and industrialization of high - tech help us to further overcome timid thoughts that high - tech is unattainable .
They have greatly enhanced our whole nation 's courage and confidence in realizing socialist modernization . "
The " 863 Program " , with a total investment of 10 billion yuan RMB and a duration of 15 years , since its implementation in 1986 , has gained breakthroughs in a large number of significant key fields of technology .
It has greatly narrowed the gap between China 's high - tech and the internationally advanced levels , and has promoted the modernization of civilian industry and the national defense industry .
In the civilian fields of biotechnology , information technology , automation technology , energy technology and new materials technology alone , more than 1200 research achievements have been made , of which 560 have reached internationally advanced levels .
This aside , China has scheduled more than 400 research projects in the fields of aerospace technology and laser technology , involving space science and application , jumbo carrier rockets , space stations , space shuttle transportation systems , and has made phased achievements in certain key technology fields .
Jian Song also cited the significant achievements that the internationally advanced level gained in fields such as agricultural biotechnology , biomedicine , genetic engineering , lasers , robotics , etc .
For example , a Chinese developed genetically engineered Hepatitis B vaccine and an " a " interferon for blocking the progress of Hepatitis B have entered the market , which is good news for the 120 million Hepatitis B virus carriers in China .
Later stages of Hepatitis B often develop into liver cancer .
China has determined its focus of high - tech research for the coming five years , and set about drawing up the next century 's high - tech research plans .
Finally , Jian Song said , " Whether our own high - tech and its industry can be successful is related to the success or failure of China 's undertaking of modernization , and is related to the rise and fall of the Chinese people .
To vigorously develop high - tech and establish a powerful national high - tech industry in our country as soon as possible is an urgent task currently facing China 's scientific and technological circles and economic circles . "

According to what has been reported in the Soviet " Science and Life " magazine , biologists in Moscow have discovered that a mold element in the cells of plants can not only control the propagation of plasmodium in mosquitoes , but can also kill mosquitoes .
This method will not pollute the environment .
Biologists mixed a mold element in the cells of plants with pearl powder to produce a granulated drug .
This kind of drug can slowly discharge the mold element from the cells of plants in water .
When mosquitoes feed , they suck the mold element from the cells of plants into their bodies .
Experiments have shown that adopting this method can reduce the chances of mosquitoes transmitting malaria down to 1/70th to 1/80th of the original ratio .

Today , the Association of the Relationship between the Two Sides of the Straits sent a letter to the Foundation for the Exchange across the Straits to exchange views on the matters of life and property loss of mainland compatriots and Taiwanese compatriots .
The communique said that on April 12th the Straits Association director expressed that the Straits Association agreed in principle , after both sides implement necessary preparations , to exchange views about the matter of contact and exchange between both sides of the Straits concerning life and property loss of mainland compatriots and Taiwanese compatriots in recent years .
The Straits Association holds that , now , both sides should first agree on topics and content of exchanging views , and then come back to consider issues such as staff levels and time , place , etc .
If both sides can not reach an agreement on topics and content , it would not be possible to find common points in exchanging views .
This type of discussion is not what compatriots from both sides are happy to see .
The Straits Association believes that the content of the exchange of views should include :
Firstly , to exchange views on the issues of tourism and contact on both sides of the Straits , including travel safety issues of compatriots from both sides .
As early as the first working discussion , at the end of August of last year , when the two associations implemented the " Wang - Gu Talks " , the Straits Association put forward in the " schedule for the discussion on implementing relevant agreements of the Wang - Gu Talks " that the associations should conduct specific discussions about " issues on strengthening tourism and contact on both sides " as soon as possible , but so far the Straits Foundation 's response has not been received .
Secondly , the Straits Association persistently advocates completely implementing discussions of topics about routine and economy , science and technology stipulated in the " common agreement of the Wang - Gu talks " , and has suggested many times to the Straits Foundation that discussions on the " rights of Taiwanese merchants investing in the mainland and related issues " should be started early .
Our association holds that the personal and property safety of Taiwanese merchants investing in the mainland have legal safeguards , and if the Straits Foundation felt it was needed , it could exchange views while discussing " Rights of Taiwanese merchants investing in the mainland and related issues " .
Thirdly , the Straits Association has repeatedly requested that both associations should conduct consultative discussions on issues of the Taiwanese military killing and wounding mainland coastal fishermen and causing serious life and property losses in recent years .
Since establishing the Straits Association , it has continuously pointed out such inhumane behavior to the Straits Foundation which seriously hurts feelings of compatriots of both sides and breaks the harmonious atmosphere on both sides , so as to attract the attention of relevant Taiwanese areas on compensating for losses , finding those responsible , and severely punishing the assailants .
It has appealed to stop such violence at the root through negotiation between the two associations .
However , up to now , the Straits Foundation 's response has not been received .
The communique clearly points out that in the above issues involving rights of compatriots of both sides of the Straits in contact and exchange , personal safety is included , so as for the long delay in starting discussions , the fault is not with the Straits Association .
The communique says that current methods of contact and co-operation between the two associations must strictly follow the " regulation agreement of contact and talks between the two associations " signed last year .
Since the " QianDao Lake Incident " occurred , the Straits Association has , according to the agreement , reported the situation to the Straits Foundation , explaining and answering a certain number of questions and requests brought up by the Straits Foundation .
However , the Straits Foundation has repeatedly raised demands that exceed the above agreement of the two associations .
Despite being reminded by the Straits Association , the Straits Foundation still repeatedly persists .
This is a practice that disrespects the agreement between the two associations .
It is continually hoped that the contact and co-operation of the two associations can be conducted in accordance with the current agreement .
The communique points out that as far as the " QianDao Lake Incident " is concerned , the top priority is investigating and settling the case in accordance with the law .
At the same time , to express further goodwill , the Straits Association has proactively invited the Straits Foundation and relevant experts to come to Zhejiang .
The Straits Association will arrange experts ' to be presented with the details of the incident and reply to questions .
If the Straits Foundation is willing to know the details of this case and sincerely understands the feelings of dependents of those who perished , then it is difficult to understand why it again sets up prerequisites ?
The Straits Association again reaffirms the above invitation , and hopes that the Straits Foundation would soon provide the date of its departure and the name list .
According to relevant sources , currently , the three suspected criminals have been arrested , and a trial will soon be carried out according to legal procedure .

It was reported that before this the five nations of the Caribbean Union had already agreed on the 30th to send troops totaling 266 people to Haiti to join the multi-national force that had a total of about 10,000 people .
Also , according to reports , United Nations Secretary General Ghali expressed on the 30th that , the peace effort by the UN trying to persuade the Haitian military government to step down had already failed because military rulers of Haiti had refused to meet with his special envoy .
On the same day , vice-minister of the US Department of Defense Doetch said that the multi-national force would soon invade Haiti , " This moment has already arrived " .
The UNSC made the decision at the end of July to adopt " all necessary measures " to regain the authority of Haitian President Aristide who was overthrown by the military .

A Spanish left - wing group and 36 other mass organizations issued a joint communique on August 31st , strongly denouncing the various measures adopted by the US to strengthen its blockade against Cuba .
The communique points out that the US government 's " adopted these measures , the purpose of which is to create an atmosphere of anxiety within -LRB- Cuba -RRB- so as to further aggravate opposition among the people and to provide an excuse for foreign intervention and military occupation of this island . "
The communique holds that methods such as forbidding overseas Cubans residing in America from remitting money and mailing articles to their families in Cuba , and sending Cuban stowaways detained on the high seas to the Guantanamo naval base , etc. is to put pressure on the Cuban government and attempt to damage and postpone Cuba 's economic recovery process .
The communique also points out that the establishment of " refugee camps " at Guantanamo by the US violates international agreements on the use of military bases .
The communique requests that the US respect the territorial integrity of Cuba , return the Guantanamo military base to Cuba , and immediately stop the blockade .
It also requests that Cuba and the US implement " full negotiations " .

Taiwan News Holds Seminar on Cross-Strait Relations
The biggest story of the year in Taiwan has naturally been the changing of the guard at the presidential palace as a result of the Democratic Progressive Party -LRB- DPP -RRB- victory in the election on 18 March .
Jin Zhong , president and editor - in - chief of Hong Kong 's OPEN magazine , which specializes in political reporting and commentary , spent an entire week in Taiwan observing the election campaign and its aftermath , and on 20 March , OPEN organized a seminar titled " The New President and Cross-Strait Relations . "
The seminar was held in cooperation with Taiwan News , one of the island 's oldest English - language newspapers -LRB- known until last year as the China News -RRB- .
The KMT ticket finished nearly 14 percentage points behind independent candidate James Soong and pulled in fully two million votes fewer than the DPP ticket , a margin of defeat which Jin Zhong described in his opening remarks as stunning .
When Chinese Communist premier Zhu Rongji made belligerent remarks a few days before the election in an effort to scare voters away from the DPP ticket , the ruling party made a grievous mistake , opined Jin , when it failed to come out strongly critical of Zhu and attempted instead to capitalize on the incident by playing the " fear card . "
At the same time , however , winning candidate Chen Shui - bian captured only 39 % of the vote , which translates to a weak mandate .
As a result , he must take a moderate line that stresses inter-party cooperation .
He will have to include a wide range of people in his government , keep a low profile , guard against any temptation to grow imperious in power , and strive to be a president of all the people .
As for mainland China 's saber - rattling , Jin argued that there is no need for undue concern .
Stated Jin , " The consequences would be too severe .
It 's not like Taiwan is without any means of retaliation .
Are the mainland authorities really prepared to see Hong Kong and Shanghai go up in flames ? "
There are other perspectives on cross-strait relations , of course .
The seminar participants basically fell into three camps on future prospects .
Some were highly optimistic , others were guardedly optimistic , and a third group argued that the crystal ball has gone cloudy .
Perhaps the most optimistic view was expressed by Ruan Ming , a visiting professor at Tamkang University 's Department of China Studies who in the 1980s was an assistant to former Chinese Communist Secretary General Hu Yaobang .
Ruan stated that Beijing 's basic position on Taiwan has not changed at all since the days of Deng Xiaoping .
" There 's nothing new in what they 're saying . "
The only thing the Chinese Communists are saying , says Ruan , is that they will attack " if Taiwan makes any sort of formal move toward independence , " and Taiwan has no need to formalize anything because changing the country 's name would be meaningless .
" No matter what you call yourself , people are still going to call you Taiwan .
It 's just like in England - the official name is the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland , but nobody calls it that .
And there 's no need to going around shouting , ' We 're a country ! We 're a country ! '
Who in the international community does that ? "
Pragmatism , please
" Taiwan needs to be more pragmatic , " says Ruan , " just like the mainland . "
They made a lot of noise ahead of the election trying to sway votes , but once the election was over they backpedaled quickly with the simple statement , " We 'll wait and see what they say and do . "
The attitude with them , in Ruan 's view , is very pragmatic .
Ruan is optimistic about cross-strait relations under the new regime , and states , " Chen Shui - bian is best positioned to improve cross-strait relations . "
He likens Chen to the staunchly anti-communist Richard Nixon , who was able to normalize ties with the Chinese Communists precisely because he was trusted by the American people .
Similarly , when Chen Shui - bian negotiates with Beijing , no one will worry about him selling Taiwan down the river .
The noted political commentator Chin Heng - wei , chief editor of Taiwan 's Contemporary Monthly , agreed strongly with Ruan 's comments , and added , " In this election the people of Taiwan were even more concerned about domestic issues than they were about cross-strait relations . "
The most pressing issues facing the new president are education , the environment , " black gold " politics -LRB- murky connections between the worlds of politics , business , and organized crime -RRB- , and crime fighting .
When Nobel laureate Lee Yuan - tseh came out in support of Chen Shui - bian , implying that the DPP represented " the progressive forces in society , " Chen 's support jumped immediately upward .
Virtually everyone at the seminar was in agreement that it is neither advisable nor necessary to seek a quick solution to the cross-strait issue , and that Taiwan need only avoid stirring up Chinese nationalism .
Wei Chengsi -LRB- news director at ATV news in Hong Kong and a former director of policy research in the public relations department of the municipal party committee in Shanghai -RRB- emphasized the fluid nature of Beijing 's policy on Taiwan .
He feels that the mainland authorities face many more pressing issues than Taiwan , and that the current tension basically stems from President Lee Teng - hui 's pronouncement on state - to - state relations .
Having been through the Tiananmen massacre , Wei felt compelled to warn the people of Taiwan , " You absolutely must not think the way the students did in Beijing in '89 .
You must not think that ' the communists wo n't attack because the US wo n't let them , ' and then go out of your way to provoke them to where they no longer have an out .
Under the wrong circumstances , failure to display strong Chinese nationalism could spell political suicide for a Communist Party leader , and he might well decide , ' To hell with the US and economic development , I 've got to attack if I 'm to stay in power . '
That would be an incredible disaster . "
Chiu Hsiang - chung , chief editor of the Hong Kong Economic Journal , also advocated cautious optimism .
In his view , there has been no fundamental change in the cross-strait relationship , but he listed a few variables that bear close watching .
The first is the combination of nationalism and Jiang Zemin 's desire to serve another term as Secretary General of the Communist Party and make his mark on history .
Could he attempt to use nationalism to further his ambition ?
Second , the People 's Liberation Army hopes to parlay the Taiwan issue into increased influence in domestic politics .
Third , Taiwan could make mistakes and give the Chinese Communists an excuse for military action .
And a fourth factor is the wishy - washy American support for Taiwan .
If all of these variables combined in the wrong way , the military authorities could make a miscalculation that would lead to war .
When hawk meets hawk
Chou Chi - ping -LRB- senior advisor at Business Weekly -RRB- and Tseng Fu - sheng -LRB- general secretary of the KMT 's Department of Mainland Operations -RRB- felt that the future of cross-strait relations is still up in the air .
Chou , as a former official with the Straits Exchange Foundation , has had direct dealings with the Chinese Communists .
He argued that the DPP 's view of the mainland has always been colored by ideology , and thus take a dim view of the other side .
It is true , acknowledges Chou , that Chen Shui - bian has changed his basic stance and now says that he " will not change the country 's name , declare independence , or seek to enshrine the state - to - state principle in the constitution . "
It is also true that Lee Yuan - tseh -LRB- who is highly respected in the mainland for his academic achievements -RRB- has vouched for the sensibility of Chen 's approach to cross-strait relations .
And yes , once again , it is true that the Chinese Communists have muted their rhetoric considerably .
Nevertheless , the two sides view each other with suspicion .
If the Chinese Communists conclude that Taiwan 's leadership has dropped its insistence on formal independence only to pursue a policy that includes de facto independence as its aim , Chou argued that this will introduce a note of uncertainty into the relationship .
Tseng Fu - sheng feels that Taiwan should claim the high ground by holding up its experience in democratization as an example for the Chinese Communists .
Says Tseng , " Reunification depends entirely on whether China can democratize . "
His biggest worry is that the deep gulf between the DPP and the mainland authorities could cause them to misread each other .
He stressed that there are both doves and hawks on all sides of the trilateral relationship between Beijing , Washington , and Taipei .
If the hawks gained the upper hand at the same time in all three capitals , opined Tseng , the result could be war .
The seminar attendants also examined Taiwan 's domestic situation .
Versatile author and cultural commentator Ping Lu offered some very incisive comments regarding the post-election protests outside the KMT headquarters .
In demanding that Lee Teng - hui resign as chairman of the KMT to take responsibility for the election defeat , Ping -LRB- herself a second - generation " mainlander " -RRB- argued that the protest revealed an ethnic fault line in Taiwanese society .
It was a venting of mass frustration on the part of one particular ethnic group , said Ping , noting that most of the protesters were mainlanders .
This group feels a loss of status , for during the many decades of KMT rule they have always thought of themselves as a privileged " majority " in Taiwan even though in fact they are a minority .
They do not identify with Taiwan as their home , and they have an unconscious feeling of superiority vis - a - vis the local majority .
In some ways the election has forced them to realize that they truly are a minority .
This development should help to bring about long - lasting ethnic harmony in Taiwan .
The participants generally felt that the election was a victory for democracy .
On the domestic front , the victory of Chen Shui - bian showed that people want more democracy , greater respect for human rights , and a more serious effort to banish " black gold " from the political arena .
In cross-strait relations Chen 's victory spells the end of an era in which the cross-strait relationship was conducted within the framework of a civil war between he KMT and the Chinese Communist Party .
Reform of the KMT and the formation of a new political party by James Soong will also improve the political system in Taiwan .
It appears that the people of Taiwan have finally taken their first bold step into an era of true democracy , and a mature political system is no longer a distant prospect .
President Chen Travels Abroad

On August 25 President Chen Shui - bian wrapped up his first overseas trip since taking office , swinging through three countries in Latin America and another three in Africa .
While in the Dominican Republic to attend the inauguration of President Hipolito Mejia , Chen had a chance to meet with the leaders of many different nations .
The president signed joint communiques with Nicaragua , Gambia , and Chad , and agreed to provide US$ 4.6 million worth of loans to the Dominican Republic to serve as a guarantee to help the latter secure a loan from the International Monetary Fund .
" We can not use pressure from Beijing as an excuse for our diplomatic setbacks , " said Chen , who used concrete actions to demonstrate to ROC 's allies that our country has no intention of pulling back from its diplomatic partnerships ; on the contrary , the ROC will be working even harder than before .
Chen Shui - bian left on August 13 for a 13 - day trip that included state visits to the Latin American nations of the Dominican Republic , Nicaragua , Costa Rica , as well as the west African nations of Gambia , Burkina Faso , and Chad .
Before boarding the plane on the 13th , Chen Shui - bian delivered a short speech in which he stated , " Taiwan must stand up and be counted . "
The purpose of this trip , said Chen , is to share Taiwan 's experiences with other countries , and he also indicated the hope that this trip would help to solidify Taiwan 's diplomatic relations .
The entourage was the largest ever to accompany an ROC president abroad , and included : Chuang Ming - yao -LRB- secretary - general , National Security Council -RRB- , Tien Hung - mao -LRB- minister of foreign affairs -RRB- , Lin Hsin - yi -LRB- minister of economic affairs -RRB- , Chen Po - chih -LRB- chairman , Council of Economic Planning and Development -RRB- , Chen Hsi - huang -LRB- chairman , Council of Agriculture -RRB- , Chung Chin -LRB- head of the Government Information Office -RRB- , Jeffrey Koo -LRB- chairman of the National Association of Industry and Commerce -RRB- , Wang Yu - tseng -LRB- chairman of the General Chamber of Commerce of the ROC -RRB- , and Lin Kun - chung -LRB- chairman of the Chinese National Federation of Industries -RRB- .
There were also many legislators in the delegation , including Hung Chi - chang , Helen Chu , Feng Ting - kuo , and Li Yin - yun .
-LRB- Li is soon to assume a position as deputy director of the ROC diplomatic post in Washington , DC . -RRB-
The total size of the delegation came to nearly 200 people , including more than 50 journalists .
The president kept to a very tight schedule during the trip .
After a brief stopover in Los Angeles on the 13th , Chen continued on and reached the Dominican Republic on the 14th .
He attended the presidential inauguration there on the 16th , and was able to meet with the leaders and representatives of friendly nations from around the world .
On the 17th he continued on to Nicaragua , where he met with President Arnoldo Aleman and delivered a speech to the Nicaraguan National Assembly .
On the 18th , presidents Chen and Aleman signed a joint communique before Chen Shui - bian departed for Costa Rica , where he received the Great Cross of Juan Mora Fernandez , a gold medal which is the nation 's highest award .
On the 20th he flew across the Atlantic Ocean to Gambia to meet with Gambian President Yahya Jameh before heading on to Burkina Faso and a dinner with President Blaise Compaore .
On the 23rd Chen delivered a speech to the Gambian parliament .
The next stop on the itinerary was Chad , where Chen dined with Chad 's President Idris Debi .
On the 25th Chen and Debi signed a joint communique and held a press conference before heading back to Taiwan slightly ahead of schedule to oversee efforts to deal with the powerful Typhoon Bilis .
Chen 's stopover in Los Angeles was a sensitive subject , for Chen had originally planned an informal meeting with several members of the US Congress .
After furious protests from Beijing and discouragement from the US State Department , however , Chen canceled the plan just the day before arriving in Los Angeles .
A crowd of 500 to 600 Taiwanese living in the United States showed up to greet the president at his hotel and protest against the US government 's " caving in to Beijing at the expense of Taiwan . "
When Chen arrived on the 14th in the Dominican Republic , he was greeted at the airport by over 100 representatives of the Taiwanese business community there , and more than 700 Taiwanese residents threw a party for the president that night at his hotel .
The next day , Chen took advantage of the upcoming presidential inauguration to meet with leaders from a number of countries with which the ROC has diplomatic relations , including the vice-president of El Salvador and the second vice president of Panama .
On the 16th Chen attended the inauguration of President Hipolito Mejia .
The ROC contingent was larger than any other at the ceremony .
The ROC currently has diplomatic relations with 29 countries , half of which are located in Latin America and the Caribbean .
In recent years , however , mainland China has continually upgraded its trade links with the ROC 's diplomatic partners .
The allegiance of a number of these countries may be put to the test in the coming years by various political and economic considerations .
In the case of the Dominican Republic , for example , supporters of President Mejia announced to the media on the eve of President Chen 's arrival that mainland China was planning to build a large thermal power plant in their country .
In addition , the Dominican Republic is seeking a seat on the UN Security Council in 2002 , and will certainly be lobbying for Beijing 's support .
This situation could affect relations with Taiwan .
On the bright side , Taiwan has scored a few points of its own in this diplomatic tug of war .
When Chen arrived in Costa Rica on the 18th , his hosts departed from the pattern of the past few years by promising to support the ROC s bid for membership in the United Nations .
Costa Rica 's President Miguel Rodriguez also accompanied President Chen on a tour of a Taiwanese export processing zone , an orchid farm run by Taiwan Sugar Corporation , and a vocational training school .
President Chen departed on the 20th for Africa , where the ROC has eight diplomatic partners .
Chen Shui - bian is the first ROC president ever to travel to western Africa .
There is little two - way trade between Taiwan and any of the three countries on Chen 's African itinerary .
Instead , agricultural and economic assistance constitute the mainstays of our diplomatic ties with these countries .
Taiwanese agricultural specialists stationed in Burkina Faso have converted 1,000 hectares of desert to arable land , while Taiwanese specialists sent to Gambia have successfully transplanted tomatoes , green beans , okra , and various leafy vegetables from Taiwan and raised them on Gambian soil .
In addition to this type of technical assistance , Taiwan has also assisted with various infrastructure projects .
Taiwan 's most notable contribution to Gambia 's infrastructure is the main terminal at the airport .
Gambian President Yahya Jameh declared his support for admission of the ROC to the United Nations , and as a gesture of goodwill declared that all holders of ROC passports would henceforth automatically be granted 90 - day landing visas upon arrival in Gambia .
President Chen 's trip yielded many positive results and generated a lot of very favorable media coverage , but it was not problem - free .
First , as the president was preparing to depart Taiwan , the Nicaraguan foreign minister publicly called upon the ROC to make good on the previous administration 's promise of US$ 100 million in assistance .
This remark sparked controversy in Taiwan , where some accused the new government of pursuing the same " checkbook diplomacy " practiced by its predecessor .
Chen Shui - bian responded that while the new administration has not made plans for any new promises of foreign aid , neither will it fail to honor the promises made by its predecessor .
Foreign Minister Tien Hung - mao stated that the purpose of Chen 's trip was to consolidate Taiwan 's diplomatic ties , and to strengthen friendships by building upon the existing foundation .
Tien stressed that the president would not sign any new foreign aid agreements .
President Chen received a very warm welcome in Nicaragua , but the local press still mentioned " checkbook diplomacy " in reporting on the visit .
The ROC 's ambassador to Nicaragua , Antonio Tsai , bluntly argued in a briefing with Chen that Taiwan 's foreign assistance to Nicaragua was being misused .
According to Tsai , the assistance has been used to build a presidential palace and a new headquarters for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs .
Opposition politicians charge that the aid has done nothing for everyday people , and Western nations have also been critical .
A second problem connected with the trip was the question of who would act in the president 's stead while he was out of the country .
Concern over this issue prompted President Chen to state before his departure that he would remain commander - in - chief of the military forces , and that he would maintain hot lines to every cabinet - level agency .
The president said that there was no need for an acting president because he had taken painstaking precautions to ensure domestic political stability during his absence .
So is Taiwan 's diplomacy a way of giving back to the international community ?
Or is it checkbook diplomacy ?
Ambassador - without - portfolio Lu Yi - cheng wrote an article in which he argued that foreign aid has always been universally recognized as a regular tool of diplomacy as well as a humanitarian necessity , and there is no reason why Taiwan should have to steer clear of it .
He pointed out that the world 's developed nations spend an average of 0.24 % of GNP on foreign aid , as opposed to 0.17 % in Taiwan 's case .
In view of Taiwan 's economic strength , argued Lu , our foreign aid expenditures need not be reduced ; in fact , they should even be raised somewhat .
The ROC has been criticized a lot in recent years for pursuing checkbook diplomacy , so there was no surprise when this issue cropped up in connection with the president 's trip .
The question of an acting president , however , has never before been a matter of concern .
This situation is to some degree a reflection of the fact that the public still has doubts about the new administration 's ability to govern .
This is an important point that is worth keeping in mind .
Paralympics Offer Stage for Taiwan Performers
Closing ceremonies for the 2000 Sydney Paralympics were held on October 29 .
Nearly 4000 athletes from more than one hundred and twenty countries participated .
This event , a manifestation of the ideal that " the flame burns in the body , mind , and spirit of every individual , " broke down international barriers and was an admirable example of the global village in operation .
The ROC team took one gold , two silvers , and four bronzes , marking the first time any Taiwan athlete has returned from an Olympic games with a gold .
Also , as part of the events , Taiwan 's Crescent Moon Dance Troupe , made up of handicapped persons , was the only foreign troupe invited by the Australian government to participate in the Paralympic Arts Festival .
But even more important than these honors was the spirit of overcoming all obstacles and facing life with courage that shone through during the Paralympics .
The just - completed Paralympics were enriched by ethnic flavorings .
The opening ceremony on October 18 was in the form of a welcoming for aboriginal elders .
Amidst a festive atmosphere , the athletes entered the stadium by categories - one group in wheelchairs , another on crutches , another led by guide dogs .
The events at the 12 - day Paralympics were packed with spectators .
The 1.1 million tickets sold show the extent to which everyone took the games seriously .
The host government even set up a huge TV screen in Darwin , which is the port of entry for the most visitors to Australia , to broadcast the games live .
The games were also a platform for the idea of the welfare state caring for disadvantaged groups , and for emphasizing how handicapped persons can break through barriers and limitations .
On October 14 , Taiwan 's Crescent Moon Dance Company created a sensation with their performance " Standing on the Highest Peak , " performed in traditional vests and short skirts as worn by indigenous people in Taiwan .
After the 10 - minute performance ended , the hall was rocked by thunderous applause .
The standing ovation lasted three minutes , and some people were even moved to tears .
The Crescent Moon Dance Company has only been in operation for four years .
Organized by a group of amputee women on a nonprofessional basis , it is the world 's first dance troupe of its kind .
As its manifesto reads : " One with no voice may nonetheless sing .
One with no wings may nonetheless soar .
One with no limbs may nonetheless dance .
The crescent moon and the full moon are the moon just the same , and equally beautiful . "
The troupe also delighted Sydney citizens with a performance at the Sydney City Hall on October 19 .
In the competition , host country Australia took the most medals , including 64 golds
.
Among the ROC 's medals , the gold - the first ever for Taiwan - was won by Chiang Chih - chung .
With a throw of 57.28 meters , Chiang shattered the world record for the javelin in the F12 visually - impaired class .
Chiang , a member of the Bunun indigenous people , received a traditional hero 's welcome home from the Bunun of Sanmin Rural Township in Kaohsiung County .
During the festivities , which were both moving and fun , tribal elders sang warrior songs and praised Chiang for his glorious deeds .
Meanwhile , the ROC table tennis team twice made it to the finals , but fell just short of the gold each time .
In the wheelchair men 's doubles class 5 event , Chou Chang - sheng and Lin Yen - hung took the silver , while Chou won another silver in the men 's singles .
The men 's class 9 team for persons with non-leg - related disabilities and the women 's wheelchair team of combined classes 4 and 5 took bronzes in team events , while Li Ching - chung -LRB- men 's judo class 1 -RRB- and Lu Li - hua -LRB- women 's powerlifting class 1 -RRB- garnered individual bronzes .
Among Asian countries , South Korea turned in the best performance , taking five gold medals .
This was due in part to the fact that the ROK government has provided special coaching in wheelchair table tennis to soldiers injured in service .
Indeed , many handicapped competitors from other nations besides the ROK were retired veterans .
Their pensions allow them free time to train , and through athletics they bring meaning to their lives and glory to their countries .
Taiwan team members , on the other hand , come from a variety of backgrounds , and train out of personal interest .
They must give up working if they wish to train full - time .
The South Korean team of veterans , by overcoming their injuries to give a display of athleticism at the international level , have emerged from the shadow of war and transformed their handicaps into glorious results .
This example should provide food for thought to the disabled and sports communities in the future .
Pali : Storied Past , Uncertain Future
-LRB- Lin I - hsien / photos by Diago Chiu / tr. by Phil Newell -RRB-
I wonder if Pali is jealous of Tanshui .
I ask because fate has treated these two towns , separated only by the mouth of the Tanshui River , very differently .
Tanshui is celebrated in poems , songs , paintings , and lovers ' memories of its scenic views .
Pali has donuts , mussels , a garbage landfill , and troubles which have yet to be revealed to the outside world .
Have you heard this legend ?
Liao Tianding , Taiwan 's Robin Hood , fleeing from imperial soldiers , took refuge in Pali , where he fell in love with a local woman , and , later , at age 27 , was murdered in the Monkey Cave at Laochienkeng -LRB- in Pali Rural Township -RRB- by one of his best friends .
Countless legends grew up around Liao after his death , and the people of Pali began to worship his spirit .
In 1958 , his small burial plot was converted into a huge temple .
He has followers scattered far and wide , and every year on the special day appointed for making offerings at his temple -LRB- the 26th day of the 10th month of the lunar calendar -RRB- , the grounds are packed with cars and visitors .
The Ko brothers , now in their 60s , recall their impressions of a visit to the Liao Tianding gravesite : " It must have been 30 years ago , we used to go there just for the fun of it .
The road in front of the temple was n't so wide then , and what a crowd !
People were so jammed in you could n't move . "
They also recall that the Pali of those days was a place in which most people lived by fishing , farming , or petty trading .
The elder Ko gives a thumbs - up and declares : " That 's why I always say that a can - do guy like Liao Tianding must be looking after us , so that we have developed and can even earn money from the tourists . "
Yet , he may not know about Pali 's real heyday , long in the past .
The days of the sailing ships
Pali was originally called Palifen , a transliteration of the place name used by the Ketagalan indigenous people .
Located on the northwest corner of Taiwan , Pali faces the Taiwan Strait to the northwest , rests against Mt. Kuanyin to the southeast , and looks across the river toward Tanshui to the northeast .
Though it does n't have much of a hinterland , its geographic location has proved historically important , as one can see from the prehistoric cultures unearthed at the Ta - pen - keng and Shih - san - hang archeological sites .
Later , when Han Chinese began trickling across to Taiwan , they mainly settled along rivers .
Because Pali is relatively close to the mainland and sits at the mouth of a river , despite the fact that it does not have a natural harbor , in 1757 the Qing court designated it to be one of Taiwan 's small number of official ports for maritime transport with the mainland .
Thus began an era in which great ships sailed in and out of Pali .
However , as a result of silting and a destructive typhoon that struck in 1796 , Pali began to give way in importance to Tanshui , located just across the river .
Once mainly dependent on fishing , Pali increasingly came to rely on farming .
But the hilly terrain and strong winds meant that there was little good land .
While the hardy people of Pali barely kept their stomachs filled , their children and grandchildren left in search of a better life .
Neither the Japanese occupation -LRB- which began in 1895 -RRB- nor the return to Chinese rule -LRB- in 1945 -RRB- brought much joy or change to this rural area .
But in the 1970s , urban planning came to Pali .
It proved to be the prelude to a symphony -LRB- or perhaps cacophony -RRB- of transformation .
Changing the rhythm of Pali life
During the height of real estate speculation and soaring land prices in Taipei , builders put up self - described " villas " and " mansions " -LRB- apartment blocks , in fact -RRB- one after another in Pali .
Also , to try to reduce the outflow of population from Pali and to get the stagnant local economy moving , the government decided to link this formerly isolated village to the outside world .
What had been Chungshan Road was turned into Provincial Highway #15 , and the opening of the Kuantu Bridge to traffic linked Pali directly to the busy Taipei districts of Shilin and Peitou .
Gifted with a lovely setting between the mountains and the sea , Pali began to dream of a tourism boom .
But fortune had other things in store .
In order to pave the way for the construction of a water treatment facility on the northeast edge of Pali , the plan to develop tourism in Pali was scrapped overnight .
The government , applying urban planning principles , zoned the area for residential and industrial use , in order to create a construction site for the facility .
Then in 1987 came the program to bring gravel from eastern to western Taiwan for construction purposes , and a harbor was built on the Pali coast for the convenience of gravel transporters .
In accordance with the urban plan , new streets were cut this way and that through Pali 's land , and high - rise buildings sprang up along the sides of these roadways .
The sounds of backhoes at work resounded even from the black sand beaches .
In 1997 , the Hsiachuotzu garbage landfill formally opened , and it became common to see fleets of garbage trucks winding through the streets of Pali .
This rural township , which was made responsible for storing the garbage from several communities in Taipei County , seemed resigned to the fate -LRB- suffered by many outlying areas -RRB- of having to choke on the garbage spit up by others .
It is only recently that the residents of Hsiachuotsu , unable to stand the smell , have begun to protest .
Lin Yi - hung , born and raised in Pali , stands on the roof of his house and looks across to the beach where he used to run and play as a child .
He can not help but sigh , as he looks at the ranks of new buildings and thinks of the dramatic changes that have come to this area : " These construction projects have destroyed the relationship we people of Pali used to have with the sea . "
It 's certainly true that a lot of people here thought they would get rich from the rezoning .
But just because land increases in value does n't mean someone will buy it , and just because apartment complexes are built does n't mean there are people who want to live there .
Worst of all , interpersonal relationships have been poisoned in the struggle over divvying up the profits , because no one really knows how much money is involved .
Lin concludes : " I am not by any means opposed to development .
But development is not necessarily the same as progress .
Can the people of Pali really survive change of this magnitude ? "
All part of the plan ?
One after another , government development plans have raised the expectations of Pali residents .
But so far the only things Pali folk have been able to enjoy have been flying dust from construction sites , roads filled with giant trucks , and new neighbors of an " otherworldly " kind .
The new roads have certainly brought in a group of immigrants anxious to escape from Taipei City and return to nature .
But at the same time , verdant Mt. Kuanyin - named for its uncanny resemblance to the deity Kuanyin - is covered with columbariums and cemeteries .
Even Kuanyin , worshipped for her limitless compassion and mercy , must be creasing her brow at this rampant overuse of the mountain .
Chen Chien - kuo , a secretary in the Pali Rural Township government , says facetiously : " What can we do ? We have the mountains behind us and the sea in front .
People say the fengshui is good here , so they come . "
He adds , in a far less amused tone , that the government has been talking about making Mt. Kuanyin a national park for a long time , and has banned construction or use of the mountain .
But after 30 years , the park plan is still a non-starter , and meanwhile many cemeteries and colum - bariums have " snuck in . "
" Nobody seems to care about our Pali , and we are very remote , so people just dump what they do n't want out here .
We say that this is why we not only have a water pollution treatment plant and a garbage landfill , but also five nursing homes and hospices for the terminally ill . "
Take the Taipei Happy Mountain Colony for example .
This venerable institution was first used to house leprosy victims , who met only fear and loathing elsewhere .
In 1932 , a British missionary founded this home - over the strong opposition of the local gentry - to offer leprosy victims a place to live in dignity and find warmth away from the cold outside world .
Today , Happy Mountain is a home for physically and mentally challenged young people , and the simple old structure , surrounded by greenery , rings with the laughter of children .
Li Li - chuan , who works at Happy Mountain , was born and raised right here in Pali .
Her family home is not far from the chil - dren 's home .
" When I was small I used to come here to play .
All the adults called the kids ' empty - headed . '
I was small , and did n't know any better , so I just called them that too . "
Stroking the head of a sleeping child with hydrocephalus , she says : " He is so cute when he smiles ! "
Located on the margins of the island of Taiwan , the people of Pali take it in stride that they must live alongside the marginal people and objects cast off by society - waste water , trash , the deceased , and victims of diseases that society would prefer not to see at all .
And there is no sign this situation will end : Reports now say that all the waste and earth being moved to Linkou for a land reclamation project there will be trucked along Provincial Highway #15 - right through the heart of Pali .
Serving Greater Taipei
" I believe , " says Lin Yi - hung , " that the people of Pali understand that this is just the way society works -
the interests of the few are sacrificed so that the majority can be better off . "
Thus , in urban plans Pali is always assigned the role of serving Taipei .
" But the government should think carefully about whether they are using the right methods or not .
There are no real comprehensive policies , just short - term trade - offs of interests .
There are a lot of great - sounding plans , but what do the people of Pali get out of them ?
It 's like the port they built for transporting gravel .
There are a lot of bright promises for the future , raising people 's hopes , but who knows what the final result will really be ? "
Chang Tsu - chou , now in his 70s , has been a secretary in the rural township government for more than 30 years , and loves Pali more than words can say .
" I was first sent here to work in the Kuomintang Public Service Department .
When I came here , they were only selling about 30 newspapers in all of Pali .
But I went all out to promote newspaper sales , and by the time I left the department , they were selling more than 1000 ! "
He has great confidence in Pali 's future , and believes the new harbor will bring prosperity .
" The government says that the first phase is for transporting gravel , but when the third phase is completed a lot of goods will be shipped in and out of here .
At that time , Pali should really be hopping ! "
Pali , known as " the home of green bamboo shoots " for its famous local vegetable , is - like many remote areas all over Taiwan - accepting the pain and enjoying the pleasures of life in the space between hopeful expectations and disappointing letdowns .
And , being marginal , it also must live with burdens that the citizens themselves do not want .
Uncertain whether to makes fists or open their arms , the people of Pali watch , perplexed , as the great wheel of our times leaves its tracks through their rural township .
Yet these are hardy people , who will always bounce back with a smile to face the unknown future , be it filled with troubles or glory .
Pali Facts and Figures
Pali Rural Township -LRB- also spelled Bali -RRB- is located at the northwestern edge of the Taipei Basin , on the western bank of the mouth of the Tanshui River .
It has an area of 39.5 square kilometers and a population of just over 28,000 .
It is one of the 29 townships under the jurisdiction of Taipei County .
Pali produces wax apples , green bamboo shoots , and wendan pomelo which are famous far and wide for their delicate texture and sweetness .
In addition , Chinese raspberries and strawberry pears are now being cultivated , with promising results so far .
The main attractions include the so - called " eight views of Pali , " the ferry boat scenic tour , hiking on Mt. Kuanyin , Formosa Wonderworld theme park , and the Liao Tianding Temple .
Pali is served by inter-city and local buses , or you can take a shuttle bus from the Kuantu Station of the Taipei rapid transit system .

Mourn for the End of an Era : Three Taiwanese Cultural Giants
-LRB- Laura Li / tr. by Jonathan Barnard -RRB-
The year 2001 has started with a series of saddening losses in the cultural realm .
On the first of the year , Hsu Tsang-houei , the dean of Taiwanese music , passed away after a fall left him in a coma .
Then came the news that Chang Kwang-chih , the respected archeologist and former vice-president of the Academia Sinica , had died of illness in the United States .
Finally , on the afternoon of January 9 , the historian Tai Kuo-hui died of septicemia .
These three masters in their fields were all in their early seventies .
Since they had just reached a time in their lives and careers where they could slow down and enjoy the fruits of their past labors , one feels inclined to complain to heaven or sigh about the brevity of life .
Each of these men was at the forefront of his field in Taiwan , and their deaths represent the end of an era .
Where should Chinese music go ?
Hsu Tsang-houei had a huge impact on Taiwanese music over the last half century .
Born in Homei , Changhua in 1928 , Hsu studied the violin in Japan as a youth .
Later , he studied in France for five years , where he became well versed in the various schools of modern Western music .
In 1959 he returned to introduce modern Western classical music to his homeland .
He also published a seminal essay entitled , " Where Should Chinese Music Go ? " in which he passionately urged his fellow musicians to create contemporary Chinese music .
Many young composers took up his call and wrote difficult and dissonant twelve - tone works that would become the creative mainstream in music departments .
Unfortunately , schools of modern classical music struggled to hold their audiences even in the West , and audiences found it harder and harder to connect with the Taiwanese modern music of which Hsu was the leading figure .
Opinion has remained polarized about the worth of this music .
Hsu was also at the forefront of efforts to record traditional Taiwanese folk music .
In the mid-1960s , Hsu , Shih Wei-liang , Lu Ping-chuan and others established various organizations , including the Folk Music Research Workshop .
Fighting the reigning bias in favor of musical traditions from the mainland , Hsu led the way in collecting and recording Taiwanese Nanguan music and Hakka eight - tone , as well as the music of the aboriginal tribes .
These collections helped to delineate the history of Taiwanese music .
In the past decade , with the rise of the " Taiwan first " movement in politics , Hsu 's folk music collections have garnered more and more attention , and CDs of them have been released one after another .
In the last few years , Hsu was appointed both as national policy advisor to the president and as the chairman of the National Culture and Arts Foundation .
Cross-strait archeological star
Just as Hsu 's work spanned from the classical to the contemporary , from the West to his native soil , the archaeologist Chang Kwang-chih 's broad vision allowed him to build the foundations for the field of archeology both for Taiwan and China as a whole .
In his autobiography , Chang describes himself as a " Yam Man , " which is an allusion to Taiwan being shaped like a yam .
Chang explains that he was actually born in Beijing , though his father 's family was indeed from Taiwan .
After Taiwan was returned to Chinese rule , Chang returned to the land of his roots .
Studying at Chienkuo High in 1949 , he was arrested on false charges of having participated in the April 6 Incident .
He spent nearly a year in jail before taking the high school equivalency exam and going on to study archeology at NTU .
After earning his doctorate at Harvard , he took an academic post in America but always maintained his focus on Chinese archeology .
Largely due to his unflagging efforts , Chinese archeology attained a sturdy theoretical and practical foundation that enabled it to emerge as a world-class discipline .
His research showed that the rise of Chinese civilization did not occur exclusively in the area around the Yellow River Valley .
Rather it emerged from several languages , ethnic groups and cultures spread over a vast landscape .
This overturned the " single origin theory " and debunked Western assumptions about " oriental despotism . "
Though a world-class scholar , Chang never forgot the land of his origins .
In the 1960s , he returned to Taiwan and embarked on research at the Fengpitou site in Kaohsiung , completing the most extensive archeological study made in Taiwan in over a century .
Then he went on to perform research in an area that spanned the Choshui and Tatu river valleys .
It was a huge undertaking that involved both archeology and geology .
Many of the leading lights among the younger generation of Taiwan anthropologists cut their research teeth on this project .
Unfortunately , Chang Kwang-chih became afflicted with Parkinson 's disease more than a decade ago .
His limbs started to shake , and it became impossible for him to perform fieldwork .
Chang deeply regretted that he was unable to examine the Shangqiu site in eastern Henan .
Though sick , Chang returned home at the end of his life to serve as vice president of the Academia Sinica , where he worked hard to establish Taiwan as the preeminent world center for sinology .
Taiwanese heart , Chinese sentiments
Finally there was the death of the historian Tai Kuo-hui , who served on the National Security Council and was admired as much for his lofty character as for his pioneering work in Taiwanese history .
His differences of opinion with Lee Teng-hui had thrust him into the spotlight in recent years .
Born in 1931 in Taoyuan , Tai was educated under Japanese colonial rule , and he earned a doctorate in agriculture at Tokyo .
Back in the 1960s , when Taiwanese history was still a taboo subject in Taiwan , Tai organized a research society in Japan devoted to the study of Taiwanese history and other related Asian topics .
For this work , he was blacklisted in Taiwan .
Later , Tai repeatedly declined invitations from Chiang Ching-kuo to return .
It was n't until Lee Teng-hui was president that he finally came home .
But when he did , his different perspective about Taiwan history brought Tai Kuo-hui farther and farther from the mainstream of the ruling party .
Although Tai did n't flinch from condemning the authoritarianism of Chiang Kai-shek and his son Chiang Ching-kuo , he also had harsh things to say about Japanese colonial rule - unlike Lee Teng-hui , who had fond memories of the colonial era .
Tai , who described himself as an " independent-minded Chinese born in Taiwan , " never lost his affection for China proper , and these sentiments set him apart from most historians of Taiwan .
With regard to cross-strait relations , Tai made his famous " testicles analogy . "
Taiwan is a part of China , he stated , just as testicles are a part of a man 's body .
Though inextricably linked to the body , the testicles have their own special functions .
He based his analogy on what he deemed was best for all of the Chinese people .
His theory was a far cry from Lee Teng-hui 's belief that Taiwan should establish clear boundaries between itself and the mainland .
But Tai Kuo-hui never shied from controversy .
Otherwise , he would not have chosen to study Taiwanese history to begin with .
Throughout his life , he maintained his tough Hakka spirit and academic independence , holding fast to his opinions and never compromising .
He was greatly admired for his intellectual integrity .
These great masters ' deaths have come at a time when the field of education has been in the spotlight for other reasons .
The Ministry of Education has just formally apologized - 50 years after the fact - for the April 6 Incident , and a university president has been found guilty of plagiarizing a research paper .
The former shows that intellectuals in Taiwan need no longer fear torture and imprisonment for their beliefs .
The latter suggests that some people have allowed blind ambition to sully the pure ideal of scholarship .
Apart from causing us to mourn , the deaths of these great men have left us with a lot to think about .

Ancient Giants of the Forest -
Taiwan 's False Cypresses
-LRB- Chang Chin - ju / photos by Lai Chun - piao / tr. by Robert Taylor -RRB-
The Bible says : " If you have faith as a grain of mustard seed , you will say to this mountain , ' Move hence to yonder place , ' and it will move ; and nothing will be impossible to you . "
For small as the mustard seed is , it grows into a mighty , spreading tree .
Applying these words to Taiwan , they most aptly describe the Taiwan red cypress , whose tiny seeds are the origin of Taiwan 's greatest trees .
From conelets three millimeters in diameter come seeds no larger than sesame seeds , yet they grow into huge trees up to 60 meters tall .
The Taiwan red cypress witnessed Taiwan 's birth , squeezed up by the collision of two tectonic plates , and its progress from a fragile mass of broken rock to a more stable geology .
It has also witnessed the rise and fall of Taiwan 's forestry industry .
Hsiuluan Village , an Atayal community in eastern Hsinchu County , was one of the last places in Taiwan to be reached by modern civilization , and was once famous as the " village without lights . "
In the mountain forest above Hsiuluan 's outlying hamlet of Chenhsipao , bushes and creepers form a dense undergrowth , and a blanket of damp fallen leaves makes the going slippery underfoot .
Every ten to 20 meters , a magnificent Taiwan red cypress , thousands of years old and with a trunk three to four meters thick , towers 40 meters into the sky .
Awe - stricken hikers standing below these great trees have the impression of having fallen into a sea of jungle , from which they can barely see the sky .
This remnant of virgin cypress forest runs northward to Taoyuan County 's Mt. Lala and to Chilan in Ilan County .
This great wall of trees acts as a vital " safety valve , " regulating the flow of water into the Shihmen Reservoir , the Tanshui River and the Lanyang River , on which millions of people in northern Taiwan depend for the water they drink .
The coat of green which clothes the mountains intimately affects water quality and soil stability in Taoyuan , Hsinchu , Miaoli and Ilan Counties .
A land of clouds and mists
Taiwan 's " false cypresses " - trees of the genus Chamaecyparis , a subdivision of the cypress family , Cupressaceae - are relics of the ice ages which brought them to our geologically young island .
Thirty million years ago , Chamaecyparis species were distributed all over the world .
But after the ice ages , the high mountains of Taiwan , which were squeezed up from the edges of two tectonic plates a million years ago , became their refuge .
Today , only six false cypress species remain anywhere in the world , scattered far apart in North America , Japan and Taiwan .
Two of them are native to Taiwan : the Taiwan red cypress -LRB- Chamaecyparis formosensis , a.k.a. the Formosan cypress -RRB- and the Taiwan yellow cypress -LRB- Chamaecyparis obtusa var. formosana , a variety of hinoki cypress -RRB- .
The home of Taiwan 's false cypresses is at medium elevations from 1,300 to 2,600 meters , which is Taiwan 's area of greatest precipitation and a major source of water for over 100 rivers .
At these elevations there is much rainfall but relatively little wind , and the mountains are shrouded in clouds and mists all year round ; hence the forests there are also known as cloud forests .
In this environment of constant humidity , the Taiwan red cypress grew into East Asia 's biggest conifer , with average heights from 30 to 40 meters .
The cypress forests also mark the transition between Taiwan 's broadleaved and coniferous forests .
False cypresses make up more than 70 % of the trees in this zone , but they are accompanied by a rich variety of other plants , including other big trees like Formosan taiwania -LRB- Taiwania cryptomerioides -RRB- , Formosan cunninghamia -LRB- Cunninghamia konishii -RRB- and Chinese yew -LRB- Taxus mairei -RRB- .
Hidden in the dark , damp understorey are a third of Taiwan 's fern species , and the millennia - old false cypresses are also a paradise for epiphytic plants - as many as 80 species have been found growing on a single tree .
Taiwan 's Earth God
The devastating 21 September earthquake of 1999 left Taiwan 's landscape covered in scars , but researchers discovered that the places least damaged by the quake were areas of natural forest .
In mountain regions where the rainfall is most abundant , the geology most fragile and erosive forces most powerful , the false cypresses , with their massive trunks and mighty root systems , cling tightly to the frail earth .
Professor Chen Yu - feng of Providence University , who has been studying Taiwan 's flora for many years , explains that false cypress forests often grew where river erosion created large areas of debris from rockslides .
As tectonic forces pushed Taiwan continuously upwards and the rivers carved their way downward , such areas of collapse occurred in many places .
Doughty false cypress seeds seized the opportunity to colonize this hostile territory shunned by other plants .
There they gradually grew into gigantic trees , rehabilitating the land and attracting other species .
At the same time they protected downstream areas , making them suitable for settlement and farming .
" The growth of the cypress forests stabilized the rubble brought down by the rushing mountain rivers .
The false cypresses are living ' spirits ' which naturally restore the land , " says Chen Yu - feng .
For the past million years , clouds rolling in on northeasterly monsoon fronts in winter and southwesterly airflows in summer have carried their moisture into the mountain valleys , to slowly condense onto the slopes where the false cypresses grow .
Steeped in this dampness , the flora and fauna of the forest continued an unending cycle of growth and renewal through the changing seasons .
The only humans who entered there were the aboriginal people who came to hunt and to collect wild fruit and berries .
Every few decades the shaking of the earth would ravage this ecosystem , but protected by the vitality of the cypresses the land would gradually recover .
The nemesis of the cypress trees
However , the advent of mechanization , coupled with human greed , heralded a period of rapacious exploitation .
In the 19th century human beings swarmed into Taiwan 's dark mountains like busy worker ants .
The false cypresses , which had conversed with the clouds for a million years , were identified as top - grade timber , and were thus condemned to an inexorable fate .
After Taiwan was ceded to Japan following the Sino - Japanese war of 1894 , while the Japanese were still quelling resistance to their rule they also went into the island 's mountains to collect botanical specimens .
In 1896 , a Japanese biologist collected the first specimen of Taiwan red cypress on Yushan , and before long the Taiwan yellow cypress was found there too .
In 1899 , the great cypress forests of Mt. Ali were discovered , and in 1912 , the Japanese colonial government began large - scale logging there .
Everywhere the Alishan Mountain Railway passes at higher elevations was once cypress forest .
Soon afterwards the forests of Mt. Taiping in modern Ilan County and Mt. Pahsien in Nantou were also opened up for logging .
Endless streams of cypress logs flowed out of the mountains , and were carried across the sea to Japan to become pillars for Shinto shrines .
Quite apart from the incomparable quality of their timber , in terms of numbers alone the Taiwan red and yellow cypress took second and third place among Taiwan 's trees , so they became long - term cash cows for the island 's forestry industry .
After Taiwan 's return to Chinese rule , from the 1950s to the 1980s the ROC used forestry income to support its industrial development .
The logging grounds advanced deep into Taiwan 's heart , consuming even greater areas than under the Japanese .
False cypresses accounted for two - thirds of the 300,000 hectares of commercial forest , and contributed 70 - 80 % of forestry income .
All of Taiwan 's forest recreation areas today are to be found in the former cypress logging grounds .
The Alishan Mountain Railway , and the long forestry roads which wind through Taiwan 's four major mountain ranges , were all built for the sole purpose of shifting the huge cypress logs down the slopes .
" You could say that everything connected with Taiwan 's forestry industry developed around the false cypresses , " says forest ecologist Yang Kuo - chen , an associate professor at Providence University .
The history of forestry in Taiwan is a history of false cypress felling , says Yang .
Hinoki and merihi
If you speak of " hinoki , " the Japanese name of the Taiwan yellow cypress , older Taiwanese will lift their noses as if catching a whiff of its unmistakable fragrance - it has a firm place in their memories as the best of timbers .
The Taiwan yellow and red cypress each have their own different qualities .
The Taiwan yellow cypress grows pencil - straight towards the heavens , and has a higher content of oil , from which a fragrant essence can be refined .
In 1971 , after the Shinto gate at the Meiji Shrine in Tokyo was struck by lightning , the Japanese authorities especially came to Taiwan to buy 11 huge , straight Taiwan yellow cypress logs 16 to 24 meters long , cut from trees over 1,500 years old , to create the world 's biggest Shinto gate .
As for the Taiwan red cypress - merihi in Japanese - it is even more magnificent in appearance than the Taiwan yellow cypress .
But the Taiwan red cypress 's trunk is often divided , and because it mostly grows in wet river valleys the heartwood is prone to be eaten away by bacteria , producing strangely tangled hollow trees .
The crown is also broad and difficult to cut .
This is why the gigantic ancient trees that have escaped the loggers ' chainsaws , such as those at Mt. Ali and Mt. Lala , are all Taiwan red cypress .
Human life is fleeting , but cypress is forever .
As the forestry industry gradually declined , the forestry huts built in the Central Range in the Japanese period fell into disrepair , but their cypress - wood washbasins are still as good as new .
The close grain of their growth rings reveals their age , and their resilience .
In the early days , the sleepers used for the Alishan Mountain Railway were cut from broadleaved trees such as beech and Michelia compressa .
But tough as these woods are , the sleepers only stood up to three to five years of logging trains rumbling over them , so there was no choice but to change them all for sleepers made of false cypress wood , which lasted for decades .
And when the railways were finally taken out of service , the Taiwan Forestry Bureau -LRB- TFB -RRB- sold off the old sleepers , and from the proceeds not only was able to recoup the cost of dismantling the railways , but was also left with a tidy sum for its own coffers .
For the older generation , the excellence of false cypress wood is hard to put into words .
Old folk to this day still rattle on about how the cypress - wood sleeping platforms of Japanese - style houses were long - lasting and hard - wearing , and how the best bathtubs were of course those of made of false cypress wood .
In the eyes of furniture makers , " False cypress wood is light and easy to work ; it is flexible , rotproof and termite resistant .
It rarely warps , and hardly shrinks ; it planes to a smooth , fine surface .
It 's so versatile : boats , bridges , carriages , cabinets or coffins - there 's not one it 's not suitable for . "
In short , of all Taiwan 's commercial timbers , there 's not another to match it .
Pining away
However , behind these sweet memories of cypress wood are the regrets of the foresters .
Surveys made before logging began at Mt. Ali , Taiwan 's earliest cypress logging area , showed that there were more than 300,000 false cypresses over 1,000 years old , but today all that remains of them is a few lonely - looking old trees scattered among introduced Japanese red cedar -LRB- Cryptomeria japonica -RRB- and flowering cherries .
Despite its great fame , deprived of the company of its own species the most celebrated of the giant Taiwan red cypresses of Mt. Ali finally succumbed to lightning and fire .
The TFB once hoped that if a few false cypresses were left standing in each of the old logging areas , they would seed naturally .
But they discovered that although the trees were completely uninjured , they died one by one .
Late Taiwanese forestry expert Liu Chin described these few remaining trees as " dying of loneliness . "
It seems that when abandoned by the companions they had relied on for millennia , and left to face the rigors of their environment alone , these ancient survivors went into terminal decline .
But an even greater cause for regret is that " 50 years of intensive false cypress logging tore the heart out of Taiwan 's life - support system .
This devastation , coupled with agriculture moving up into the mountains , can only result in landslides , floods and all kinds of ' natural ' disasters . . . . "
With ecologists ' warnings ringing in their ears , now that floods and mudslides have become a common occurrence , people can only nod in tacit agreement .
Large - scale logging of false cypresses continued right up to 1989 .
With forestry earning no profits , and in response to energetic lobbying by civic groups , the Executive Yuan finally banned the cutting of natural forests , at last giving a respite to the giant trees which protect Taiwan 's land .
But the great wall of 20 million gigantic false cypress trees which once stretched the length of Taiwan had already been breached .
Apart from some scattered local stands , the Taiwan red cypress forest of Mt. Hsiukulan in central Taiwan , and the 10,000 - plus hectares of Taiwan yellow cypress at Mt. Chilan in Ilan County in northern Taiwan , are the island 's only remaining forests of giant trees .
Whose national park ?
Humans cut down the million year - old cypress forests in less than a century , but the story of their destruction is not over .
Amazingly , the ban on logging natural forests has not protected Chilan , the only single - species forest of hinoki cypress surviving in the world today .
Before the ban , the Vocational Assistance Commission for Retired Servicemen -LRB- VACRS -RRB- , which manages Chilan , had already cut down almost 6,000 hectares .
To generate income , VACRS has continued logging there under the pretext of " clearing away dead and fallen trees to make space for young trees to grow . "
Ecologists and biologists can only repeat again :
" The trees have been growing by themselves for tens of thousands of years , so why would they need human help for their saplings to grow ? "
In response to this situation a popular movement sprang up to push for the establishment of a " cypress forest national park , " in the hope that with national park status , the last remaining virgin Taiwan yellow cypress forest could be saved .
Perhaps the millennium year was a decisive one for the trees , for the Executive Yuan allocated new funds to the VACRS so that it no longer needs to cut down trees to bolster its finances , and also approved a plan to set up a national park .
But so - called ecotourism is now emerging as another threat to the trees ' survival .
To assure the livelihood of the local Atayal aborigines of Chilan , when the cypress national park is set up consideration will have to be given to how to balance the need to protect the forests with the demand for sustainable tourism .
How can Taiwan 's false cypresses become more than just a tool of human economic activity ?
Can the sad history of cypress logging teach the people of Taiwan a lesson in how to truly care for their land ?
Perhaps these questions are still more important than the issue of establishing a national park .
A future for the cypresses ?
At the Atayal village of Chenhsipao in Hsinchu County , by three in the afternoon the clouds rolling in from afar have quietly slipped over the ridges and covered the whole mountainside where the cypress trees grow .
Here , in Taiwan 's remote but vitally important heartland , gigantic trees which have survived the long river of time and escaped the ravages of logging stand undaunted , like guardian spirits quietly protecting the Atayal people and Taiwan 's land .
Only if we can allow the cypress trees a future , will the people of Taiwan also have a lasting future .

This Taiwan red cypress planted by the Japanese at Mt. Ali in 1915 has now reached a girth of 70 centimeters .
But the smallest commercial size of Taiwan red cypress is 150 centimeters .
This means that artificially planted trees are not ready for harvest until they are 300 years old .
Hence since the false cypress forests were cleared , Taiwanese - preferring quick profits - have generally planted Japanese red cedar , which is ready to be felled after only 20 years .
Innocents Abroad
Educating Taiwanese Kids in the PRC
-LRB- Jackie Chen / photos by Diago Chiu / tr. by David Mayer -RRB-
When Taiwanese business people take up an expatriate lifestyle , the thing they worry about most is family matters , especially the education of their growing children .
For Taiwanese expatriates in mainland China , incompatibility between the Taiwanese and mainland education systems is the main reason why most of them do not move their families across with them .
In the city of Dongguan , located just over 40 kilometers east of Guangzhou , the ground has already been broken on a project to build the first school for Taiwanese children in mainland China .
There is an especially large Taiwanese expatriate community in the Dongguan area , and there are high hopes that the new school , scheduled to begin officially enrolling students in September , will go a long way toward solving the nettlesome problem of education .
" Sometimes I get to thinking that I 've achieved absolutely everything I set out to do in life , " says H. D. Ye , " then I take a look at my family 's situation and it seems as though I have n't really done anything at all . "
As chairman of the board at Dongguan Primax Electronics Products , Ye has nine factories and over 4,000 employees under him .
Why would someone so successful be so down about his situation ?
Says Ye with a worried frown , " Recently my wife has been calling me a lot from Canada to talk about her problems trying to maintain discipline with our kids .
They 're getting out of control , and we 're afraid they might get into trouble .
They say it 's tough to try and raise children as an expatriate , and I can sure attest to that . "
I 'm doing this for you
Ye has worked hard for many years for the Taiwanese community in Dongguan , a subject he cares deeply about .
" I do n't care if it 's nothing more than a thatched - roof cottage ; I want to get a school for Taiwanese children up and running . "
After stepping down from his former position as chairman of the Taiwan Businessmen Association of Dongguan -LRB- TBAD -RRB- , Ye took over as director of the Dongguan Taiwanese School Preparatory Committee .
Says Ye , " I 'm even busier now than I was before . "
Of the more than 3,000 Taiwanese business people in Dongguan , less than 5 % have been joined by their families .
With the extended absence of these people from Taiwan , undisciplined children and lonely spouses " cause a lot of problems for families and society as a whole , " says Ye .
There are a number of reasons why family members are unwilling to move to the mainland -
some spouses have jobs in Taiwan , crime is a concern on the mainland , and the quality of medical care is not so good there .
For people with families , however , the key stumbling block is the quality of education .
Asks Sylvia Yang , deputy chairperson of the TBAD Women 's Division , " What are we working to achieve , anyway ?
We want a better life for our children , of course . "
She adds that while the education system on the mainland is not so bad , Taiwanese people have a hard time getting used to the way of life there .
" How would you feel if your child learned from his classmates to cough up phlegm all over the place ?
Sorry , but that 's not something you can get used to . "
Grumbles one businessman , " My kids have come home singing the national anthem of the PRC , and calling Chiang Kai - shek a thug and Lee Teng - hui a public enemy .
Now how do I handle something like that ? "
In the opinion of Norman Hsu , vice president of a foods company whose family of four had spent a few years in New Zealand before moving to Dongguan , " The first thing to do is ask the children their reason for saying such things .
Ask what their teachers say , and what they themselves think .
Then go on to give them your own views . "
While many consider Hsu 's approach a very enlightened one , there is no denying that at the gut level the influence of mainland Chinese culture rubs the wrong way .
Comments one Taiwanese businessman , " You worry that your kid is going to become a communist . "
Taiwanese people in the mainland invariably wish to maintain their ties with Taiwan , and are particularly anxious to ensure that their children can integrate quickly into the school system back home once they return .
With the number of Taiwanese in Dongguan increasing in recent years , it was just a matter of time before a Taiwanese school was established .
Thanks to the vigorous advocacy of H. D. Ye , the TBAD began working seriously in 1994 to establish a school , but the difficulties were considerable .
They had to find land , funds , teachers , and much more .
With Taiwanese and mainland authorities at political loggerheads , the school 's promoters had to jump through hoops every step of the way in seeking to hire teachers from Taiwan , use Taiwanese teaching materials , and appoint a Taiwanese person to the post of principal .
They also had to obtain the cooperation of the authorities in Taiwan .
Since the people in Dongguan were paying taxes in Taiwan and planning to run the school according to the Taiwanese system , they asked whether the Ministry of Education might not treat the school the same as any private school in Taiwan , and subsidize it accordingly .
Teacher seniority was also a major issue in the effort to get the school established ; if teachers from public schools were to teach in Dongguan , would they retain the seniority that they had built up in Taiwan ?
" If we had n't been able to hire experienced teachers , " notes Ye , " it would have seriously impaired the quality of our faculty . "
Ye continually stressed to authorities in both Taiwan and the mainland , " Politics is for the politicians .
In the meantime , our children need an education .
That 's all we 're asking . "
The main obstacles were finally overcome by the end of 1999 .
The mainland Chinese authorities have agreed to allow the use of Taiwanese teaching materials and faculty .
As for the appointment of a principal , TBAD vice chairman Andrew Yeh states , " I think the mainland authorities will handle the situation flexibly .
They 'll probably let us hire who we want as long as we agree to refer to the person as a director or something like that . "
The Dongguan city government has leased an 86,000 - square - meter site to the association at an extremely low price , and the school 's cornerstone was laid last year in a ceremony held on 3 November .
The school will begin admitting students this coming September and start classes in October .
The school will accept elementary and junior high school students at first .
The decision about whether to open senior high school classes will be made later depending on demand .
Where to send the kids ?
H. D. Ye notes that there are now about 400 children of Taiwanese expatriates in Dongguan who attend school in the mainland .
Greater than half attend mainland China 's regular elementary and secondary schools , while the more affluent Taiwanese send their children to private schools for expatriate children .
Chang Mei - liang , chairperson of the TBAD Women 's Division , is among the latter group .
After her elder son and daughter finished elementary school in Taiwan she sent them to a boarding school in Britain .
Her ten - year - old child is too young for that though , so she sends him to a school in Shenzhen for the children of Hong Kong expats .
The child only comes home once a week , and sending him to the school in Shenzhen costs several hundred thousand NT dollars per year .
The Hong Kong elementary school and the international school are both an hour or two away from Dongguan , and many of the Taiwanese in Dongguan want to be able to see their children every day .
This prompted a group of them to establish a private bilingual school called Little Oxford in February 1998 .
The school admits children from kindergarten -LRB- age five -RRB- through grade five of elementary school .
Some of Little Oxford 's 200 students -LRB- such as Norman Hsu 's child -RRB- used to go to school in Shenzhen , while others have transferred in from the mainland Chinese public school system .
Little Oxford is very similar to the Taiwanese school being promoted by the TBAD .
Most of its teaching materials are very similar to those used in Taiwan 's elementary schools , and of the 15 or so teachers there , three are from Taiwan .
The big difference is that classes are taught in both Chinese and English because the Taiwanese parents are very interested in seeing that their children learn English well .
According to Huang Su , executive director of Little Oxford , " A lot of parents keep after me to make sure that the children 's education is exactly like the regular system in Taiwan , but I have to remind them that once you 've left in Taiwan , you 're not regular any longer . "
According to Huang , making the school a mirror image of those in Taiwan does not necessarily mean that you are running a good school .
The key is to provide an education that meets the needs of the students .
In addition to Taiwanese teaching materials , she has also incorporated some materials from the mainland and overseas into the curriculum .
Huang Su , who hails from Beijing , majored in English at university and is keenly interested in education .
She came to Dongguan after marrying a Taiwanese expat there , and it was the Taiwanese business community that asked her to run a school .
Little Oxford now has a very good reputation in the Taiwanese community .
In fact , some Taiwanese send their children to Little Oxford from as far away as Zhuhai -LRB- just opposite Macau on the other side of the Pearl River estuary -RRB- .
Huang has been deeply impressed by the deep concern that Taiwanese parents show for their children 's education in the face of difficulties posed by living away from their native Taiwan .
One parent , for example , practically begged her to admit his six - year old child , explaining , " He 's never had any playmates .
The only people he 's ever been with are his nanny and some employees from the plant . "
The Taiwanese kids at Little Oxford come from many different backgrounds .
Some speak in a mixture of Chinese and English , while others speak and look just like any mainland Chinese child .
Many of them have transferred in and out of lots of different schools in the United States , Taiwan , and the mainland .
There is no trace of the world 's cares on their faces though ; the thing they 're most concerned about is studying a little less and playing a little more .
One bespectacled child laments , " School is better in Canada because they do n't have to do so much homework .
There 's too much homework in Taiwan and the mainland .
It 's no fun . "
An older brother and sister , it turns out , have both lived overseas .
Huang stays in close touch with the Taiwanese parents .
Their children enjoy very comfortable homes and seem to have experienced much of the world , but the biggest problem is that " they are n't motivated and do n't understand why they should need to study . "
Another problem for the school is the lack of interesting things to do in Dongguan .
Unless teachers are very devoted to education , they are not likely to stay there long .
" It 's all the more difficult , " notes Huang frankly , " to hold on to teachers from Taiwan , who ca n't help but compare their situation here with what they are accustomed to in Taiwan . "
The Taiwanese school will be faced with the same high turnover rate that has dogged Little Oxford .
Dongguan , cradle of scholars
With Little Oxford already in operation , why should the Taiwanese expats wish to establish a separate school for their children ?
Sylvia Yang points out that Little Oxford is a private school with limited space and teaching staff , and even without the boarding expenses charged in Shenzhen , the tuition at Little Oxford still costs RMB 38,000 -LRB- NT$ 160,000 -RRB- per semester , more than many Taiwanese parents can pay .
Says H. D. Ye , " We would like to get funding from both the Taiwan and mainland authorities to hold tuition down . "
Although the cornerstone has already been laid , Ye reports that not enough funds have been raised , nor have all the teachers been hired .
Although the picture generally looks pretty good , there is still much work to be done .
Expenses for the first few years are expected to reach NT$ 60 million , and only about NT$ 20 million has been raised so far .
Ye often speaks in Taiwan on the topic of investing in the mainland , something which he knows a lot about .
Says Ye jokingly , " I jack up my speaking fees to make extra money for the school . "
The TBAD is now considering funding the school through an endowment , shares in which would be sold to business firms .
The location for the school has already been selected .
It is a large site in the township of Zhongtang .
The lot is basically empty right now , but the roar of excavators fills the air , and the steel piles have already been driven .
The school grounds are located next to the ancient Beidi Temple , which is shaded by the leaves of a spreading banyan tree .
On the temple gate a fading couplet reads : " He who is truly dedicated to his endeavor will become a great master , and shall make of his surroundings a land of delight .
He who has achieved true wisdom shall make of his home a cynosure for great talent , no matter where he may be . "
The locals must have taken this message to heart over the years , because it is said that hometown scholars from Zhongtang often took the top spot in the imperial examinations of centuries past .
It is very gratifying that a place like Dongguan , with its abundant business opportunities , should also have a scenic spot so rich in scholarly tradition .
It is also exciting to look forward to the founding of a school for the Taiwanese business community .
Apart from making money , will the expatriates here create a " Taiwanese miracle " on the cultural front as well ?

Little Oxford , a bilingual elementary school attended primarily by the children of Taiwanese expatriates , guards its entranceway closely .
A school bus takes students to and from school , and all visitors must announce themselves before entering .

Little Oxford elementary school teaches classes in both Chinese and English , which is just what the Taiwanese expatriates want for their children .

H. D. Ye is a key player in Dongguan 's Taiwanese expatriate community .
He has played the lead role in establishing a Taiwanese school in Dongguan .
The community 's ability to wrap up preparations and start construction in just two years is due in large part to Ye 's energy and enthusiasm .
In the summer of 2005 , a picture that people have long been looking forward to started emerging with frequency in various major Hong Kong media .
With their unique charm , these well - known cartoon images once again caused Hong Kong to be a focus of worldwide attention .
The world 's fifth Disney park will soon open to the public here .
The most important thing about Disney is that it is a global brand .
Well , for several years , although it was still under construction and , er , not yet open , it can be said that many people have viewed Hong Kong with new respect .
Then welcome to the official writing ceremony of Hong Kong Disneyland .
The construction of Hong Kong Disneyland began two years ago , in 2003 .
In January of that year , the Hong Kong government turned over to Disney Corporation 200 hectares of land at the foot of Lantau Island that was obtained following the largest land reclamation project in recent years .
One .
Since then , this area has become a prohibited zone in Hong Kong .
As its neighbor on Lantau Island , Hong Kong International Airport had to change its flight routes to make this area a no - fly zone .
Mickey Mouse 's new home , settling on Chinese land for the first time , has captured worldwide attention .
There 's only one month left before the opening of Hong Kong Disneyland on September 12 .
The subway to Disney has already been constructed .
At subway stations , passengers will frequently press the station for Disney on ticket machines , trying to purchase tickets to enjoy the park when it first opens .
Meanwhile , the Disney subway station is scheduled to open on the same day as the park .
For two years , Disney has constantly maintained its mystery .
No media have been allowed to enter for photos .
We took a taxi along the path of the highway that heads toward Disney , trying to experience this mysterious park from close by .
However , before any of the Disney symbols were in sight , the car was stopped by a security guard at the intersection of the road towards Disney .
On our way back , the taxi driver gave us an explanation after understanding our intentions .
Er , according to what the security guard said , for the time before everything is officially , opened , , no cars can enter unless they have special permission .
No one can enter otherwise .
Video recording is especially forbidden .
Ah , everything is top secret .
If pictures are taken without permission , %pw that is to say , it will at all times be pursued by legal action , a big hassle .
Although Disney Corporation chose Hong Kong as the venue for the Chinese Disney park , what they are actually most excited about is the mainland China tourist market .
Since the implementation of the Individual Visit Scheme between Hong Kong and the mainland , more and more mainland tourists are coming to visit Hong Kong .
From the beginning up till now , more than seven million individual tourists , have come to Hong Kong .
Well , we now , er , believe more will be coming .
At this point , it has been about two years .
Also , the current number of 34 cities will be increased .
Hong Kong was developed from a fishing harbor one hundred years ago to become today 's international metropolis .
Here , eastern and western cultures have gathered , and the new and the old coexist .
When in Hong Kong , you can wander among skyscrapers , heartily enjoy shopping sprees in well - known stores and malls for goods from various countries , and taste delicious snacks from all over the world at tea shops or at street stands in Mong Kok .
You can go to burn incense and make a vow at the Repulse Bay , where all deities gather .
You can enjoy the most charming sun - filled sandy beaches in Hong Kong .
You can ascend Victoria Peak to get a panoramic view of Victoria Harbor 's beautiful scenery .
Or hop onto a trolley with over a century of history , and feel the city 's blend of the old and the modern in slow motion .
After dark , cruise Victoria Harbor at night to enjoy the enchanting evening view .
Every corner of Hong Kong is filled with fun .
Meanwhile , as various new items are constantly being added , what other kinds of pleasant surprises will the Hong Kong tourism industry bring us ?
Over the past 28 years , the Ocean Park has basically been a must - see destination for tourists coming to Hong Kong .
Watch spectacular performances by dolphins and sea lions at the Ocean Theater , and experience passionate screaming and accelerating heart - beat adventures on amusement rides .
Or ride the giant Ferris wheel to get a bird 's eye view from high above of the magnificent panorama of Hong Kong Island and the South China Sea .
These items , which were the pride of the Ocean Park , have made this place the most popular tourist attraction in Hong Kong for some time .
However , since Disney entered Hong Kong , the Ocean Park , sharing the same city as Disney , has felt the pressure of competition .
To improve the park 's brand , they are planning to invest 5.5 billion in a renovation project starting in 2006 .
It seems that for the future , we have a scheme , a major renovation plan .
That is , the entire park will be divided into seven sections for renovation .
Ah , additional , newer , ah , attractions will be available for tourists .
It seems that those attractions like the North Pole and the Marine Life Center will also be renovated after several years .
Are they going to be different from what they are now ?
They will be , in ten years .
Ah , there will be more animals , and more animal species , different from what there is now .
It looks like we will also bring in whales .
Er , we will implement this plan as soon as it is approved by the government .
Groundbreaking is expected to start next year .
Yes .
The area of Hong Kong is only one thousand - plus square kilometers .
The population is dense .
Natural resources are relatively scarce .
However , the clever Hong Kong people will utilize all resources they have created for developing the Hong Kong tourism industry .
Among these is the Avenue of Stars .
Entering Hollywood of the East ,
here , you can come up close with the stars in your mind .
He is my .
She is my Goddess , ah .
Please stay with us on New World Travel .
Hong Kong has always worn the crown of Hollywood of the East .
Over the past 100 years of film history , Hong Kong cinema has nurtured many internationally renowned directors , actors , and screenwriters .
They have shortened the distance between Hong Kong and the world .
Hong Kong movies have even become a window for the world to see Hong Kong , which have made the image of metropolitan Hong Kong more prominent internationally .
For this reason , in 2004 , on the Waterfront Promenade originally constructed for viewing only the scenery of Hong Kong Island and Victoria Harbor , the Hong Kong Tourism Board also constructed the Avenue of Stars , memorializing Hong Kong 's 100 - year film history .
Here , tourists can learn about Hong Kong 's film history , and can come up close with the stars in their mind .
Hong Kong is a busy metropolis .
Even at dusk , the city 's pulse never stops beating .
Across from the Avenue of Stars , a special performance is staged every weekend .
%pw As our Victoria Harbor is %pw very famous , and , er , our nightscape is already very beautiful , by what means could we enhance the dynamic beauty of our nightscape ?
So , one idea was to transform Victoria Harbor into a performance stage .
Er , each key building is like a performer .
It is based on this that music and lights are arranged to reflect each other and perform a unique , er , and fascinating multi-media world - class light show .
Let me now introduce to you all the well - known skyscrapers participating in this large - scale light and music show .
The PLA Hong Kong Garrison Plaza , Bank of China Tower , at 8:00 every Saturday night , HSBC Main Building .
Their performances will be on schedule .
Center of the East Central .
Ten landmark buildings located on Hong Kong Island reveal themselves one by one , participating in the show in full splendor , presenting a world - class light extravaganza to a musical rhythm .
Whenever there is a major event or holiday , fireworks are also added to the light show .
Some , er , cities have consulted with us .
Uh-huh .
Their area of surprise was that those private , er , buildings , that is , the business community , ah , is willing to invest in our overall project .
Yes .
The answer is that this is a reward to the entire society , not an individual building 's reward .
Er , of course , after SARS , we felt that all of Hong Kong hopes to be involved , so that the Hong Kong tourism industry will recover , rebound together with other sectors .
Hong Kong Wetland Park , which is currently under construction , is also one of the designated new projects of the Hong Kong SAR government for advancing the Hong Kong tourism industry .
This is a park intimately connected with nature , being built by the Hong Kong government for its people who live in a city of reinforced concrete .
Hong Kong Wetland Park covers an area of 61 hectares , including a 10,000 square meter visitor 's center and a 60 hectare outdoor wildlife habitat .
In the indoor exhibition hall , tourists can learn about types of wetlands in various parts of the world , and to gain knowledge about wetlands .
Outdoors , they can also personally experience wetland ecology .
, er , from the highest point we can see two different ecological environments .
Ha , on that side are many tall buildings , that is , towns with lots of people living there ,
but behind me is our Wetland Park .
Ha , entirely different .
Quite primitive ,
er , a fresh water swamp ,
er , the Wetland Park Exploration Center .
Lastly , farthest away you can see Putian of Shenzhen .
Then , , on the bridge is Hong Kong and outside is Shenzhen .
You can come into intimate contact with nature in the outdoor wetland environment .
Children can get to know different animals and plants , and even some crops that are rarely seen in our daily life .
Over here are paddy fields , which is rather unique .
Ha , there are aquatic plants inside .
Ah , the most special is rice , because %pw many Hong Kong children nowadays have never seen what rice looks like .
Look over there .
They are going to be ripe soon .
The long one over there .
Oh .
Yes .
, with ears , ah .
Where ?
Ah , here .
Perhaps there will be an introduction so that children will know the names of the crops when they see them .
, let them get some understanding .
Mai Po Marshes adjacent to Wetland Park is a major wildlife habitat within Asia .
Each year , over 50,000 migratory birds fly over Hong Kong 's skyscrapers and choose to roost for winter here .
As a result , three different types of aviaries were built in Hong Kong Wetland Park .
These have become the best spots to observe birds .
Among common birds , a rather special one is the black - faced spoonbill .
It is an endangered bird species throughout the world .
Uh-huh .
Ah , there are only about 1,500 in the world .
Wow .
Um , however , each year , about two to three hundred of them come to Hong Kong to spend the winter .
Some of them , er , have stayed in Hong Kong Wetland Park .
Uh-huh .
So , our park 's logo is unique , featuring this black - faced spoonbill , which hopefully can draw people 's attention .
Uh-huh .
Wetland Park workers are now in the middle of intensive work .
They will complete the park 's entire construction by the beginning of 2006 , to be able to participate in the 2006 Discover Hong Kong Year campaign .
Ah , we have established the year 2006 as Discover Hong Kong Year .
Why is that ?
Because , as everyone knows , our Disneyland will open in September of this year .
In addition , we will have Ngong Ping 360 , that is , the cable car , er , to the Giant Buddha .
They add to what we already have , like the Avenue of Stars , which is also very famous .
Moreover , er , we are including our software .
Hong Kong 's software is very well known .
Like what 's used in our Symphony of Lights .
We hope to use , er , a variety of hardware and software to package this entire 2006 Discover Hong Kong Year .
Without planning it in advance , they chose to settle here .
A dream that has been anticipated for more than twenty years will soon come true here .
Because your line connects us with two --
In recent years , Hong Kong 's tourist attractions have gradually moved from Hong Kong Island to Kowloon and the New Territory .
Two out of the four new attractions participating in the 2006 Discover Hong Kong Year are located on Lantau Island of the New Territory .
For this reason , Lantau Island has become a new Hong Kong tourism popular spot .
The earliest to settle here was this world 's largest outdoor seated bronze Buddha .
In Chinese Buddhism , there are five directions - east , west , south , north , and center - and five Buddhas .
Therefore , Hong Kong 's Tian Tan Giant Buddha at the most southern tip of China , together with Lingshan Giant Buddha in the east , Leshan Giant Buddha in the west , Yungang Giant Buddha in the north , and Longmen Giant Buddha in the Central Plains , exist as the representative Buddhas for each of the five directions of China .
As a result , this place has become holy land in the hearts of male and female devotees .
However , to common tourists , more of what this place brings them is wonder and awe .
Since this giant bronze Buddha settled on Lantau Island , the world renowned Hong Kong International Airport at Chek Lap Kok and Disneyland have also been constructed here in succession .
The important status of Lantau Island is increasingly apparent .
No , it was totally inaccessible in the past .
In the near future , construction will also begin on a cross-sea bridge connecting Hong Kong , Zhuhai , and Macao .
In 1992 --
Could n't go in summer --
So , after their return , Macao , and Hong Kong , the two special administrative regions , are basically still using ships and helicopters to stay connected .
It 's extremely troublesome to get there via land .
One has to go up to Shenzhen , Dongguan , then go through Panyu , keep going up , to Zhongshan , and certainly go to Zhuhai , then pass through Zhuhai to get to Macao .
For a Hong Kong person choosing to go there via land , it 's extremely inconvenient .
A full twenty years ago , Hopewell Holdings Group Chairman Wu Ying - sheung , a well - known construction tycoon , boldly made a cross-sea bridge proposal .
With this bridge , the distance would be very small , only a little over one kilometer .
However , due to various reasons , bridge construction was put off .
This is what we have seen since 1999 .
Anticipated for 20 years , today this dream is finally coming true .
Well , originally the construction of the new --
With this new Hong Kong - Zhuhai - Macao bridge that basically leads to all three places , Hong Kong , Macao , and Zhuhai , basically , at the start of the bridge , you can get on the separate road to the place you want to go .
Macao is this way , and Zhuhai is this way .
From the perspective of either Hong Kong , Macao , or Zhuhai , our concept is a tourism zone .
Er , %pw Zhuhai for sightseeing tours , Macao for entertainment , and we have Disneyland and , other attractions in Hong Kong .
Each place has different attractions of its own .
So , with this bridge , when some old friends , friends from mainland China or from foreign countries come to our place , it seems they can basically enjoy a complete tour with great convenience in several days , before , ha , going home .
Once the Zhuhai - Hong Kong - Macao bridge is built , it will no longer be a dream of tourists to enjoy gourmet food in Macao before having fun at Disneyland just an hour later .
Promotion of Hong Kong Disneyland has long since begun .
However , even though it has entered the last countdown period before its final opening , this wonderland is still unwilling to take off its mysterious veil .
Ah , currently it has been decided that Disney will open on September 12 .
There 's also what we call soft opening .
Ah , they are now rehearsing .
Ah , , ah , some groups , they are rehearsing their service , well , hoping that they will become used to the service , be familiar with it , when our tourists come in September .
Well , I am very confident , that when our tourists come to Disneyland , they will certainly return home very satisfied .
The Wonder Tour will start from Hong Kong .
This dynamic metropolis never ceases its movement .
It continues to explore ; it continues to open new worlds .
Each day , there is always something new for people to experience and to love about this city .
Hong Kong is a world famous shopping paradise .
What determined the position of Hong Kong as a shopping paradise ?
Is it because of abundant merchandise or high quality at low prices ?
Is it a paradise for the rich or the general public ?
After all , what are the joyful memories from inside paradise ?
We respectfully invite you to watch Hong Kong : a Shopping Paradise in this edition of Across China .
Hello , everyone .

Did this World War Two pilot perish when his training flight crashed in the mountains like twenty - five other ill fated flights more than sixty years ago /?
The search for clues takes us to Honolulu Hawaii to the joint powmia accounting command or jpac /.
The mystery of the frozen airman is just one of more than a thousand different unsolved cases that scientists here at jpac are trying to solve /.
In this laboratory alone I 'm surrounded by the remains of at least twenty different service members who are in the process of being identified so that they too can go home /.
The investigation begins with a team of forensic specialists who probe and study the airman 's bones teeth and his belongings to piece together who he is /.
And almost immediately clues begin to surface /.
Dr. Robert Mann a forensic anthropologist has determined that the airman was Caucasian and had fair hair /.
Next though I 'm going to have to look at his clavicles /.
The airman 's collar bones and pelvic bones prove that he was in his twenties and died in an airplane crash /.
This is a person who likely died on impact versus perhaps freezing to death up in the mountains /.
I think that uh the injuries were so substantial um and severe that he would n't have felt anything /.
He would have died immediately /.
One two /-
Another important clue /.
He has a significant number of uh fillings /.
Like the bones xrays of his wisdom teeth also tell us something about his age /.
Root tips are closed /.
they 're sealed up which is more indicative of someone who would be at least twenty - one years old /.
And Dr. Andy Henry notices something else /.
The airmen have straight teeth /.
so he had a nice smile good teeth /.
Yes I would have to say that yes /.
Then there are the material clues the things he had on him when he died that offer a snapshot into who he could have been /.
If there 's a badge or anything else that /-
We know he was wearing a World War Two army air force uniform /.
Remnants of his sweater undergarments and socks are still intact /.
And more clues emerge from his tattered uniform a corroded nameplate this pin on his collar and this army aircorps insignia /.
When I found these insignia I was happy to see them /.
And our young white - haired airman also carried this black comb and some pocket change forty - five cents worth /.
Some of these dimes are in ranging from nineteen thirty - six to nineteen forty - two /.
In his uniform breast pocket Dr. Paul Emanovsky found this vintage Schafer pen and three small leatherbound address books /.
The pages have been decomposing /.
but could they contain names of friends and loved ones /?
And we 're going to put it in a spectral comparator /.
At first nothing /.
then like magic clues begin to emerge /.
Uh you can see all these letters from the calendar Sunday Monday Tuesday up at the top one nine four and two /.
Nineteen forty - two /.
Yeah /.
After hours of meticulous examination of each address book they yield no personal information clues that could have faded with time /.
And so while we still do not know who our twenty - something fair - haired airman is enormous progress has been made /.
Out of the thousands of unidentified World War Two service members Dr. Mann says they 've narrowed it down to just ten /.
So what was it like to grow up there /?
In Pleasant Grove we recently met these three sisters all in their eighties who have high hopes that the frozen airman proves to be their big brother Glen Munn whose plane went missing in the Sierra back in nineteen forty - two /.
Oh I just wanted you know to know that he was found and that we can have him brought home here for burial and /-
We do n't know that though /.
We do n't /.
but that 's my wishes /.
And until they learn otherwise they say they will keep that hope alive /.
And in the weeks and months ahead scientists are convinced they will identify this airman and return him home to his family wherever they might be /.
Thelma Gutierrez CNN Honolulu Hawaii /.
And there are some new developments to talk about tonight /.
Scientists may be even closer to solving the mystery /.
For an update we 're joined by Dr. Robert Mann one of the senior scientists you just saw working on this cold case /.
Thanks for spending time with us tonight doctor /.
We understand since Thelma left your laboratories you 've now wittled this down to perhaps four airmen /.
is that true /?
Well hi Paula /.
yes we have /.
Uh when the remains came in a little over a week ago our analysts and historians got to work on that /.
and they were able to wittle it down the number of missing aircraft uh to a few /.
and at this point they 've wittled it down to one aircraft and a missing crew of four individuals /.
So we 've gone from several possible aircraft to one aircraft and from several missing airmen to four /.
So how much easier will that make it for you to unlock this case , do you think /?
Well I think it 'll help quite a bit /.
Um any time you 've got a body uh or remains like this that has come in and they 're in pretty good condition such as this one is , it 's mummified remains /.
We have some soft tissue we can deal with /.
so we can look at the color of the hair /.
we can tell right away the race and the sex of the individual /.
but then there are other things that are hidden beneath the soft tissue that are revealed only in the skeleton /.
and that 's where we 're going to now /.
So in the interest of full disclosure what I know about forensics is basically what I 've learned on CSI /.
and one would think that because you 've got it now narrowed down to four potential airmen that perhaps you could go to four families get strands of hair and try to do a potential DNA match with what you 've found in the ice /.
Is it not that simple /?
Well no no it 's not that simple /.
Um one thing we always caution people about is the pool of aircraft and missing airmen could be larger than what we 're looking at /.
And what we want to do is we do n't want to just look at the material evidence that we have and immediately um jump to a conclusion that this is a certain individual /.
What we want to do is have the evidence speak for itself /.
and when we look at this individual as we 've done the biological profile looking at his remains his bones his teeth and the material evidence /.
and what we 're able to tell from this individual is that he died in his twenties he stood somewhere between five foot nine and six foot two inches tall um he sustained massive trauma to his body on impact /.
And he 's Caucasoid male /.
and so we know much more now just one week later than what we did when he came in about eight days ago /.
So the most important question is when do you think you 're going to know exactly who he is /?
Well that 's the most commonly asked question that we have /.
and you know the reality is nobody can give you the answer /.
Nobody knows for sure exactly when we 'll identify him /.
What it depends on is that all the lines of evidence come together for successful identification /.
If I were to give my best opinion in this it would be a few weeks to a few months /.
Well we 'll be keeping our fingers crossed for you /.
Know how hard you all are working in the lab there Dr. Mann /.
Thank you for spending some time with us tonight /.
Our pleasure /.
Thank you Paula /.
thank you /.
We 're going to turn now to some of the other stories in our world tonight /.
Here 's Erica Hill from Headline News /.
Hi Erica /.
Hi Paula /.
we start off with a tragic dispute after a traffic /.
a tragic death has now been settled in court /.
Now the dispute came between divorced parents over where to bury their son who was killed in Iraq /.
A California judge has now ruled army staff sergeant Jason Hendrix to remain buried next to his grandfather that is in Oklahoma where his father lives /.
His mother claimed her son wanted to be buried in California where she lived /.
but the judge says her testimony was quote forced and contrived /.
Austin Texas Republican Congressman Tom DeLay gets his way /.
The judge scheduled to preside over his trial was removed from the case today /.
DeLay 's attorneys heads off the recusal because they questioned the judge 's impartiality since he had contributed to Democratic causes /.
DeLay is charged with money laundering and conspiracy /.
He has pleaded not guilty /.
In Washington the federal reserve once again raising a key short term interest rate by a quarter percent /.
It is the twelfth such hike since June of last year /.
More could be on the way /.
In its statement the fed dismissed concerns that the economy has slowed down because of Hurricane Katrina /.
And in case you missed it the Royals are here /.
Today Britain 's Prince Charles and his wife Camilla laid flowers at the World Trade Center site in New York and then dedicated a nearby memorial to British victims of the nine eleven attack /.
It is the first stop on their eight day trip across the United States Paula /.
and I 'm sure I 'll be hearing a little bit more about it all week /.
Yeah Erica I actually um bumped into them along with three hundred of their closest friends earlier tonight on their last stop of the day here in New York /.
and they were uh uh uh amazingly casual and accessible /.
We were all quite surprised /.
That 's good to hear /.
Thanks Erica /.
see you a little bit later on /.
And still to come on News Night tonight the saddest post-Katrina stories were those of the eldery who died in hospitals and nursing homes /.
Now there are thirteen investigations into why and how such tragedies happened /.
And supermodels are n't the only ones to whom weight matters /.
Jockies also may go too far to stay thin much too far /.
When at my worst I was heaving three or five to six seven times a day /.
Starving to stay thin that and more still to come on News Night /.
They happen to be the most vulnerable of hurricane victims the elderly many desperately ill living in nursing homes their fate in the hands of others /.
Dozens died /.
There are at least thirteen investigations now underway /.
And at some nursing homes the failure to evacuate cost lives /.
In other cases it was the evacuation itself that proved fatal /.
Here 's Keith Oppenheim /.
My mother was Thelma Wahl /.
She was ninety years old /.
She was a very good mother /.
She was at Huntingdon because she needed care /.
Priscilla Scott is mourning /.
Her ninety year old mother Thelma Wahl was a resident of the Huntingdon Place Nursing Home in Chalmette outside New Orleans /.
Priscilla says Thelma Wahl had serious osteoperosis fractures in her vertebrae but says Thelma was not on the verge of death /.
On Sunday August twenty - eighth the day before Hurricane Katrina struck the nursing home decided to evacuate patients /.
They waited too late to make the decision /.
Priscilla says her mother should have been transported by ambulance /.
Instead she says her mother sat on a school bus for twelve hours to Lafayette Louisiana normally a three hour trip /.
She says police told her there was no air conditioning /.
Police declined comment /.
The owner of the nursing home Thelma Wahl was being taken to tells us by the time the bus arrived Thelma Wahl was dead /.
I feel that uh the bus is what did it to her /.
She was alive when she left that nursing home /.
but she was not alive when she got to the Lafayette area /.
CNN made repeated attempts to contact administrators or representatives of Huntingdon Place /.
but either we could not make contact or our calls were not returned /.
But staff for the Louisiana Attorney General 's office did speak to us by phone and confirmed that the matter of just what happened to Thelma Wahl when she was transported from this facility is under investigation /.
After dozens of patients died in the wake of Hurricane Katrina nursing homes have been under scrutiny /.
Thirty - four patients were left behind at Saint Rita 's nursing home in New Orleans when Katrina hit /.
They all died in the flood /.
The owners were charged with negligent homicide /.
The county coroner says he urged Saint Rita 's to move its patients /.
They insisted several patients were too fragile to move /.
Before Hurricane Rita a busload of nursing home residents were being evacuated from Houston /.
but during the ride a fire from a back wheel accelerated because of oxygen canisters patients on board were using /.
Twenty - three people died /.
Federal officials are investigating /.
No charges have been filed /.
Joe Dodges executive director of the Louisiana Nursing Home Association says when it comes to evacuations elder care facilities are damned if they do and damned if they do n't /.
Walk a mile in our shoes that 's all I have to say because anybody who works in a nursing home will very quickly learn that these are very fragile patients /.
We did the very best we could in these situations /.
We 've got /-
Dodges says the reality is old sick patients are always in jeopardy when a hurricane strikes a dilemma made worse by massive traffic jams during pre-storm evacuations /.
I mean if they 're on a bus for nine or twelve hours there 's a good chance someone 's going to die unfortunately /.
Certainly it 's a very very difficult question to answer should I evacuate /?
Jeff Meitrod and Steve Riddyah write for the Times Picayune New Orleans ' daily newspaper /.
They say nursing homes had to make tough calls /.
But last spring in a series of stories called State of Neglect they reported that Louisiana 's nursing homes are often poorly run and poorly regulated /.
Nursing homes that kill residents nursing homes that um seriously injure patients um because of bad care /.
uh and the state does n't really do very much about it /.
and so nursing home owners know that in a lot of cases it 's less expensive to break the rules and to hurt people than it is to provide the level of care that /-
Huntington Place was criticized in the articles and has had several law suits brought against it /.
but it had a good inspection record /.
Priscilla Scott says she is trying to contact the nursing home owners but has n't been able to find them /.
She feels even if they had to make a tough call they owe her a better explanation as to why her mother died /.
Keith Oppenheim CNN New Orleans /.
It still is n't clear why Huntington evacuated Thelma Wahl by bus rather than by ambulance /.
but officials have said there were not enough ambulances to take care of everyone in the region /.
Tomorrow night I will have a special report on a struggle that affects more than ten million Americans including one million men the struggle with eating disorders anorexia and bulimia /.
As I just said it 's not just women and girls who are affected /.
Men too struggle with these disorders /.
and I interviewed one of the nation 's top jockies Shane Sellers about the battle he waged everyday to control his weight /.
In the morning I 'd get up and take a diet pill um drink a cup of coffee um and then head out to the race track and /-
With no food in your stomach /.
No food in my stomach no /.
And um you know you go and see the trainers and work your horses in the morning that you have to work /.
Um by ten o'clock you 're finished uh /-
Were you hungry at this point /?
Oh I 'm starving you know /.
I mean I went to bed with nothing in my stomach either /.
Maybe you know just a piece of ham or s- /-
You know just grab something to put in my stomach before I went to bed and head to the track and maybe lay down for an hour and then uh head to the hotbox for a couple hours four or five pounds of water /.
The hotbox is a sauna a fixture in almost every jockey locker room /.
The hotbox sweatbox /.
Sellers would often spend two hours inside pooling or sweating off extra pounds /.
And are you miserable the whole time you 're in there /?
Oh it 's horrible /.
You have to be very weak /.
Weak /.
Ca n't have nothing /.
Yeah you 're already dehydrated you know /?
So for more than twenty years you went through this process of basically not eating anything during the day sitting in the sauna a couple hours a day sweating two or three pounds off getting back on your horses training and maybe maybe having a piece of ham /.
and that 's all you had to sustain you /.
If I did eat anything sometime , when at my worst three or five to six seven times a day I was heaving /.
Jockies call it heaving or flipping /.
doctors would call it bulimia /.
Overcome by hunger pains Sellers would eat massive amounts of food and then throw it up to make weight /.
He says a tour of a jockey locker room shows you just how easy and accepted it was /.
These are regular toilets /.
and this is what they call a heaving /.
this is where they heave /.
You know it 's a much different type of commode /.
I do n't know if it was especially made for that purpose /.
but it 's sure not the same as the other /.
and that 's what we used it for /.
Is it true that some of you got so efficient at flipping that you could actually do it without putting your finger down your throat /.
I was one /.
Jockey Shane Sellers just one of the many people you 'll meet tomorrow night in Walking the Thin Line /.
It is a special edition of Paula Zahn Now that gets underway at eight pm eastern /.
Still to come on News Night tonight the Senate shuts down the doors clears the gallery /.
Was today 's rare closed session needed to gaurd national secrets /.
or was it a political forum /.
And the president wants billions to help fight a possible bird flu pandemic /.
Sounds like a lot of money /.
but will it actually be enough /?
Also tonight rap star Fifty Cent may be at the top of the charts /.
but one LA neighborhood is n't buying it /.
We ca n't say how those who will be voting on Samuel Alito 's nomination to Supreme Court feel about him /.
but we can say something about how you feel tonight /.
Here are the results of the CNN USA Today Gallup poll released just minutes ago of those asked about the president 's choice Judge Alito to succeed Justice Sandra Day O'Connor /.
Seventeen percent said he 's an excellent choice /.
twenty - six percent called him a good choice /.
twenty - two percent rated him only fair /.
seventeen percent thought he was a poor choice /.
Questions about the facts or what were presented as facts that led the United States into the war in Iraq spilled into open warfare today on the Senate floor /.
Democrats forced the Senate into a rare closed door session /.
Republican leader Bill Frist said the Senate was hijacked /.
CNN 's Ed Henry was there /.
A Democratic sneak attack that sent shock waves through the Senate /.
Mr. President enough time has gone by /.
I demand on behalf of the American people that we understand why these investigations are n't being conducted /.
Democratic leader Harry Reed accused Republicans of failing to probe allegations the White House manipulated intelligence to justify the war in Iraq /.
And in accordance with rule twenty - one I now move that Senate go into closed session /.
President I second the motion /.
An easy but rare maneuver with extraordinary consequences /.
The Senate chamber was locked down , television cameras shut off , so law makers could go into secret session to debate /.
Republican leader Bill Frist was enraged /.
Not with the previous Democratic leader or the current Democratic leader have ever I been slapped in the face with such an affront to the leadership of this grand institution /.
There has been at least consideration for the other side of the aisle before a stunt /.
and this is a pure stunt /.
Reed refused to back down demanding the Republican led intelligence committee finish a long awaited report on whether the Bush administration twisted intelligence /.
This investigation has been stymied stopped , obstructions thrown up every step of the way /.
That 's the real slap in the face /.
that 's the slap in the face /.
And today the American people are going to see a little bit of light /.
What 's really going on is Democrats feel emboldened by the indictment of Vice President Cheney 's former chief of staff believing this is their chance to issue a broader indictment of the Bush administration /.
We have lost over two thousand of our best and bravest /.
over fifteen thousand have been seriously wounded /.
We are spending more than six million dollars a month with no end in sight /.
and this Republican led Senate intelligence committee refuses to even ask the hard questions about the misinformation /-
Republicans insist they 're completing the investigation /.
and this is just a distraction /.
This is purely political /.
This is settling an old political score /.
Democrats say they also want to signal they 're ready to stand up to the Republican majority and may even filibuster the president 's latest Supreme Court pick Samuel Alito a move that would make these events seem like the opening fireworks in a much nastier battle /.
Ed Henry CNN Capitol Hill /.
So do you think we just saw the outlines to what the midterm election battlelines might look like /?
A debate that 's likely to rage on for many many months to come /.
Turning our attention now to something that has a lot of folks concerned /.
You 've been hearing an awful lot about avian or bird flu /.
The most common and deadly form has already spread in birds from South Asia to Europe /.
And now there is real concern that the virus could mutate and become devastating to humans /.
In fact some health experts say it 's just a matter of time /.
Today President Bush unveiled a seven point one billion dollar plan to prepare for a possible flu pandemic /.
Now much of that money would go toward stockpiling enough vaccine to protect twenty million healthcare workers and other first responders speeding up production of vaccines and buying the anti-viral drugs Tamoflu and Rolenzo which in some cases prevent flu infection /.
And we now turn to senior medical correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupto who has just gotten back from South Asia where bird flu has in the past two years killed at least sixty - two people about half of those who were struck with it /.
Hundreds of millions of birds around the world have been destroyed to try to contain the disease /.
And Dr. Gupto now just joins us from the Emory University hospital in Atlanta /.
Always good to see you doctor /.
So /-
Thanks /.
I know you 've had a chance to study the plan the president put forth today /.
Does it go far enough in your estimation /?
You know what 's sort of interesting Paula /.
on one hand it is remarkable that the president is devoting as much time and as much money uh all towards a disease that does n't exist yet /.
Pandemic flu does n't exist yet /.
But a lot of people are talking about it /.
and I think that 's remarkable to a lot of people eh who are citizens and a lot of people in the public health community as well /.
On the other hand to be able to outline and do the thing that were talked about today to basically completely revamp the public health system so that local officials can talk to state officials that can talk to federal officials to be able to pinpoint exactly when a cluster of bird flu happens that takes probably a lot more money and really a complete revamping of our public health systems /.
The other thing Paula really important is that they talk a lot about the fact that we 're a lot better at taking care of patients now than we were in nineteen eighteen , we have a lot of ICUs a lot of ICUs in the hospital behind me that can take care of critically ill patients /.
The problem though at any given time eighty to ninety percent of those ICU rooms are full so we just do n't have the surge capacity and that 's going to cost lots and lots of money to create a health system where we can take care not only of the ill now but the ill that might come in with a pandemic Paula /.
Uh let 's talk about the other problem of the plan where the president wants to spend a billion dollars to stockpile antiviral medicine like Tamaflu and Rolenza /.
Do we even know if these two medications are going to be effective against a strain that has n't even presented itself /?
here 's the important thing about that /.
We do n't know for sure /.
A lot of people focusing a lot of energy on Tamaflu and Rolenza /.
These are antiviral drugs /.
they are not vaccines /.
They are antiviral drugs uh designed to basically shorten uh how bad the flu might effect you uh try to lessen its impact /.
But we only know that it might work because of laboratory studies and animal studies uh uh in particular /.
The way to really study it would be to knowingly expose people to bird flu /.
and nobody will actually ever do that study for obvious reasons /.
So it 's just theoretical really for the most part that those will work Paula /.
Dr. Sanjay Gupto thanks for the update /.
By the way are you catching a cold /?
A a little bit /.
You know I just got back /.
and the ninteen hour plane ride /.
Not bird flu though /.
I can assure you that Paula /.
Chicken soup /.
That 's right /.
Just what the doctor ordered /.
Works all the time /.
Yeah right /.
I made a free house call for you doctor /.
Coming up on News Night Tonight , cooking a turkey is fine /.
appearing in one is n't /.
Will her Nielson do to Martha Stewart what her prison time did n't /?
Rapper Fifty Cents or Fitty Cent as some of you say sells millions of records /.
but one neighborhood does n't like the sales pitch /.
They call him Fitty Cent /.
but he is worth millions /.
His music like the gold single PIMP may come straight from violent inner city streets /.
but suburban kids from coast to coast love the heavy base beat /.
The music sells /.
but not everyone is buying the message /.
Savela Vargas reports /.
Fitty Cent 's film Get Rich or Die Trying has n't even hit theaters yet /.
but its marketing has already enraged people in South Central Los Angeles /.
Since two thousand there have been eight hundred homicides in this community /.
Now who wants to uphold that standard /?
Who wants to keep perpetrating that madness /?
The movie 's billboard shows the rapper in a crucifixion - like pose brandishing a microphone in one hand and a gun in the other /.
Paramount you are doing damage to our community /.
you are doing an injustice to our community /.
and you committing violence in our community /.
and that includes Fifty Cent too /.
It must go /.
And go it did /.
A day after about twenty five people rallied in Hyde Park Paramount pulled one sign down and since has pulled about half a dozen others near LA area schools /.
I think what happens oftentimes people are so overwhelmed in communities particularly African American communities by say an image in this case Hollywood /.
It just seems so big /.
it just seems so overwhelming /.
it 's almost like can we really fight City Hall /?
Whatever we 're going to do no matter how much outrage and anger that we express it 's not going to change anything /.
But in this case that was shown that that 's not the case /.
A Paramount spokesman says the company is reviewing billboards in other locations /.
Now similar complaints are coming from Brooklyn New York /.
Back in LA the image hits too close to home /.
Not too long ago we was over here /.
and a guy just pulled out a gun and was shooting right in front of my daughter /.
We did n't come back for a week cause I was scared and she was /.
So I mean that right there it enraged me /.
Not a good message /.
No it 's already enough gang violence out here /.
We do n't need that /.
Cynthia Levas director of Golden Day preschool thinks the billboard touched a nerve because many children here are Fitty Cent fans /.
When it comes to ABC they be like A B /.
and you have to wait for the other letters /.
but Fitty Cent song they can sing that word for word /.
Rapper Fitty Cent whose real name is Curtis Jackson says it was ludicrous to single out his poster /.
You got to look at how often we put out action films and other films that utilize weapons as a marketing tool /.
We 'll find guns or weapons on the cover of films probably more often than we 'll find people 's faces /.
He thinks the controversy will lead the film to greater box office success /.
but to the members of this community the victory is knowing that somebody listened /.
Man they heard us /.
They heard our voice /.
and I 'm glad /.
I mean I mean usually in this area nobody really cares /.
so for them to care about how we feel and how you know we raising our kids that meant a lot to all of us /.
so I 'm happy /.

IED Improvised Explosive Devices take a terrible toll /.
And prison barely dented her popularity /.
but can Martha Stewart survive her primetime ratings /?
Everyday in Iraq US soldiers work very hard to reassure local civilians train the Iraqi army and stay alive /.
but with the increasing power of Improvised Explosive Devices IEDs staying alive takes a lot of training and time /.
Eddie Shrahmin is imbedded with American soldiers in northern Bavil province /.
As the uh informants /-
Come here Strovell /.

Like the soldiers he commands Lieutenant Colonel Ross Brown suits up daily trying to rid his area of roadside bombs /.

The first stop today is Route Tampa some of the worst stretch of highway in what is called the Triangle of Death /.
Salaam Alakum /.
where these stall owners Brown told are aware of impending attacks /.
Did you know in advance that the IED was going to go off here /?
/.
Tell him to look me in the eye /.
/.
tell me that again /.
/.
It is a fine line to walk routing out information without creating new enemies battling an insurgency that kills at will , that turns civilians into accomplices /.
I think they 're scared to death /.
I think they see us as temporary and they got to live with those people forever /.
Finding friends locally seems the toughest part of Brown 's strategy /.
but his next task proves just as difficult /.
Here the Lieutenant Colonel has stopped at one of the firm bases one of the areas that Iraqis are manning their own position /.
The commander on duty emerges out of uniform /.
and the Lieutenant colonel struggles to find progress /.
they did n't do too much work yesterday /.
They did n't do too much work the day before /.
They have n't done too much work since they 've been here /.
/.
Brown is unsure if this unit can survive an insurgent attack uncertainties shared by the US forces as well each soldier with his own way to cope /.

Eddie Shrahmin CNN northern Bavil Province /.
And we turn our attention now to London where a memorial service was held today for the fifty - two victims of the bomb attacks in the city 's public transport systems back in July /.
Queen Elizabeth and Prime Minister Tony Blair attended as did relatives to those who died and emergency workers who responded to the terrorist attacks /.
Andrew Carey has the story of three firefighters who were first on the scene at one of the bombings /.
A major incident in central London /-
Four explosions ripping through the subway s- /-
Chaos on services with some passengers trapped underground /.
It began as any other day you know just uh doing eh normal checks /.
At nine o'clock we started our shift /.
And so the bells went /.
It was about a minute past nine when we got the shout for uh smoke issuing in Allgate tube station /.
The explosion at Allgate was the first of the four bombs to go off on July the seventh at eight fifty in the morning /.
But Paul Kelly Steve Sodbury and Mel Anderson of Shadwell Firestation 's blue watch had no idea what had happened as they got into the fire engine to answer the call /.
On the arrival at Allgate we saw dozens of casualties outside the front sitting down /.
and it looked so serious that for one second I thought this must be like a training exercise /.
These people had flesh injuries /.
but they also had psychological injuries /.
They just needed reassurance /.
They just needed reassurance because a lot of them were scared /.
It always happens to someone else on the television a terrorist incident /.
As medical teams arrived at the scene Steve Paul and two other firefighters went into the station /.
This scene of walking down the platform and down the tracks with lines of injured people walking past you out the other way is /-
I 'll remember it forever I think /.
By the time they reached the second carriage they knew they were dealing with a bomb explosion /.
Carnage /.
A man sitting down next door he had half his leg /.
um a person lying down /.
there was like a half a torso in front of the carriage as you go in /.
It sounds very harsh to say now /.
but when you 're down there and you 're dealing with it it kind of just happens /.
You go into autopilot /.
and you look /.
and you think I ca n't help that person /.
let 's move on to the next one /.
Eight people including the bomber died at Allgate /.
one hundred and twenty were injured /.
At the end of the day back home with their loved ones a time for the firefighters to reflect and some mixed emotions /.
To them it was their happiness to see me walking through the door /.
but I knew that somewhere someone 's daughter was n't coming home , their father was n't coming home /.
Watching it on the news is completely different to looking in the eyes of a wounded person /.
As a fire brigade you 're there to rescue them /.
so it 'll always be a sense of regret as we did as much as we could but there was still a human cost and there 's nothing that we 'll ever be able to do about it /.
Andrew Carey CNN London /.

Still to come the ups and downs of Martha Stewart and the British are coming ! The British are coming !

are n't they already here /?
But does anyone really care /?
And now we 're going to take a look at the trials and tribulations of Martha Stewart /.

Um , this is the first time I 've seen you , and I 've always wanted to ask you a question .
Ah .
Usually directors , otherwise , they have beards and very long hair , or otherwise they shave their heads .
Oh .
Oh ! I had n't thought about that .
Actually a shaved head is really hard to manage , is n't it ?
Do you have to shave it every day ?
Right , yes .
Um , when I 've slept so much I ca n't wake up , I just shave my head and I 'm awake .
And do you need to polish it somehow ?
Then do you rub a little oil of some kind on it ?
Oh , after I shave it I rub on a little oil .
Is it cold in the winter ?
Pretty cold .
Do you wear a hat ?
In the winter ?
It forces me to wear a hat .
That 's a question I 've always wanted to ask .
Um , I 'm sure that there are many people when they introduce you , aside from saying Director Ye Daying who has shot such and such , they ca n't avoid the cliche , they always have to say " I 'd like to introduce Marshall Ye Ting 's grandson . "
Your father , Ye Zhengming , was Marshall Ye Ting 's second child .
Right .
Oh !
But today we 're telling Ye Daying 's story .
Let 's start with when you were young .
When you were young you were very naughty .
Ye Daying was born in Changchun in 1958 .
Although by that time his grandfather Ye Ting had been dead for 12 years , the Ye family maintained its status as a highly esteemed Communist household .
The next year the entire family transferred to Beijing , and Ye Daying spent his childhood there .
He and his little friends went fishing , raised dogs , hunted sparrows , chased ducks , and many years later these supremely happy memories are all preserved in his movies and plays .
One , two , three , four .
Ducks were the most precious asset in our village .
The village mayor gave them all to me .
The mayor said to me , there are eighty - six in all ;
he had me check to see that there were none missing .
But I never did count them all carefully .
77 , 78 , 79 , 80 , 81 , 82 , 83 , 84 , 85 , 86
Did you see ?
Are there 86 of them ?
Yes .
Ye Daying 's mother , An Qi , was an educated woman who worked at the Changchun Film Studio .
And his father , Ye Zhengming , was an outstanding son of the revolution .
Because after the Wannan Incident Ye Zhengming and his father Ye Ting were imprisoned for two years in a Kuomnintang prison .
But then , and for the same reasons , just after the Cultural Revolution started , Ye Zhengming was treated as a major capitalist roader .
That year Ye Daying was just eight years old .
His family 's sudden misfortune left the young Ye Daying with very disturbing memories .
He changed from a very well - behaved child into a naughty child .
From that time on he often did things that went beyond the norm , sometimes to protect himself and sometimes to take care of his family .
Ye Daying just corrected us ; he said that Ye Ting should not be called Marshal Ye Ting but rather General Ye Ting .
Right , right , right , General Ye Ting .
Why , is there a big difference between marshal and general ?
Um , he died in '46 .
That marshal , afterward , after Liberation , um , it was conferred on him , so only then --
OK , we 'll call him General Ye Ting .
Mm .
Because ,
Very naughty ?
To what extent were you naughty then ?
In fact I was a very well - behaved child .
But I was , forced into it , , if you were n't naughty there was no way to survive .
What do you mean forced into it ?
During the Cultural Revolution , , um , my family was considered capitalist roaders .
So the kids then did n't want to play with you , or they would tease you , that sort of thing .
Mm .
So you always had to be fighting with people , such things ,
Why was that ?
Was it because people for example would say that your father was such and such , or your family was such and such .
Right .
So it was because of that sort of thing ?
Right , the majority of it was like that .
Mm .
Mm .
Because you had to face them alone , OK , a dozen people who wanted to fight you .
You had to show your stuff right off the bat , and you had to be tough .
So that was , the only way you could overcome them and get the upper hand .
Mm .
Were you tough ?
Mm .
Very tough .
Tough enough to --
Because , there was no way , if you were n't tough that was it , , how could you manage .
You were the son of capitalist roaders , , you thought it was natural to be the object of bullying , and it 's perfectly normal .
Mm .
, I remember one time , we were digging out an air - raid shelter , that --
Those , good kids , they went there and threw stones .
I did n't dare defend myself , so I just had to endure it for quite a while .
Mm .
Finally a very big rock , a lump of earth , hit me on the head , And I got angry , so angry that I rushed out with a shovel and hit them with the shovel .
Where did the shovel come from ?
From digging the air - raid shelter , it was there , right .
Mm .
So you picked up the shovel and rushed them .
Did you crack somebody 's head open ?
Mm , anyhow , yes , I cracked their head open , it was very tragic .
All of a sudden nobody was making a sound .
Very --
Once I fought back , for several years after nobody dared mess with me .
How many of them did you take out ?
I hit one of them and that was enough .
Nopbody went to get the schoolmaster or somebody 's father ?
They did , and there was a huge fuss .
Mm .
Because when I was little , having a big fight like that .
Mm .
Anyhow , more or less , , on average , every two years I changed school , and that 's how it had to be .
Mm .
I remember one time -- Mm , also , when I was in fifth or sixth grade , someone yelled out , Down with Ye Zhengming , he was yelling at me , and I had to fight them .
Mm .
After the fight I went home , and my father was standing far away .
, the factory , , on the street , somebody had written in huge letters Down with Ye Zhengming , , the slogan .
Mm .
I got accustomed to it while passing by at that time , and now when I think about it , it seems very much like a stage play .
Mm .
Back then I felt , looking at him standing so far away --
I walked over to him , and he said , um , you really do n't understand anything .
At the time I felt like I had a grievance .
And I felt , I was fighting for you , the people were cursing you , and I was fighting them .
In fact that 's the way kids think .
Mm .
You think , you bastard .
What you say does n't count .
you come after me and I 'll take you down .
You come down , and I 'll take you down .
If you have balls , you come on down .
Come on down .
Come down .
Come down , come on , fight , fight , fight .
I say you take a whack .
Whack .
I 'm telling you , if you kill somebody you 'll pay with your life , do you understand ?
, You 've already handed him over .
I sent someone .
OK , OK , I sent someone , so you come on and take a shot at me .
Come on , take a whack at me .
Take a whack at me .
Your dad knows who broke the window .
Take a whack .
Take a whack .
Take a whack .
Are n't you willing to be friends with us ?
Yes , I am .
He says he 's willing .
Did you hear ?
He says he 's willing .
Ok , that 's all right , let 's go play .
This is a movie directed by Ye , called There 's a Place Called Wangjiazhan .
Wangjiazhuang , right .
This is obviously him as a boy , uh , a memory of his childhood life .
Right .
Right .
Which child is you .
Is this child you , or is that child you ?
Actually we should be accurate ; this child 's experiences ,
So this child ,
Um , right , right , right , because once , I
My father was denounced , and then the rebels took us , took that child to see .
Mm .
They denounced my father , so I was very indignant ,
They let a lot of people expose my father ,
Mm .
Then the day after I took a kitchen knife and ran over to their home , that research institute , the doorway and vowed that I 'd hack the guy up .
A kitchen knife ; a knife from your kitchen at home .
Oh , right , right , a knife from my kitchen at home .
Then I was standing there , lots of people surrounding me , and in fact you ca n't just hack people up .
But I had already said it .
What did you say ?
said I have to hack him , have to hack , so it was more or less like this child .
But , those adults standing around reasoned with me , said look , you do n't understand this .
If you do this , you 'll stir up more trouble , and then wo n't your dad be even worse off ?
In fact when they said that , my mind had already eased .
I could not lose the face this way , , So then I ran over and took a whack at the door , to get an excuse for myself .
Was it all ruined ? The door --
I slashed it twice .
Um , was n't there any consequence ?
Mm , there was no consequence , , I just let the adults reason with me .
Mm , and this is a memory from your childhood years .
It , had a great influence on me .
Including that village , that environment , it 's all very familiar to you .
More or less , very close to me , this is a novel of .
Mm .
Mm .
, the reason I like it is because , um , it brings up lots of that kind of childhood memories .
Mm , you spent a large part of your childhood in Beijing .
What year was it that you moved to Shanghai ?
How old were you at that time ?
, In '69 I was 11 years old .
Mm .
Mm , well .
In '69 at the age of 11 you went from Beijing to Shanghai .
Mm , your living environment changed , but perhaps that mischievousness had n't completely passed .
Mm , as he puts it , looking at it now , some of the memories can be very painful , but it was pretty happy days .
I went there every day and then they suspended classes , , so I could n't go to school , could n't go to class .
Mm .
So , later I remember there was -- Mm . A guy in the engineering team , and he brought Quotations from Chairman Mao and said to me , He said , now take this , now take these Quotations from Chairman Mao and teach yourselves , and in the future you 'll take up arms and teach yourselves .
A lot of people were very happy , very excited , because they were bringing back the college entrance exams , why were you feeling so depressed ?
Right , but the problem --
Because , I had never studied well ,
In 1966 the Great Cultural Revolution came , and at that time Ye Daying 's family moved from Beijing to Shanghai to live .
His father Ye Zhengming was being criticized as a capitalist roader at the research institute , and the political situation was getting worse by the day .
And the change of regions did nothing to change the violent nature of Ye Daying 's life .
He was still struggling at the edge of preserving justice .
When you got to Shanghai the environment changed ; did n't your whole person change ?
After I got to Shanghai , , settling into , , that ,
All that time , from '69 to '76 , I graduated from senior middle school , it all took place there .
Mm .
At that time in school , there were some special children , there was a special class , the better students , were you in that class ?
Right , right , , see , like study classes to educate good kids .
What kind of people were in your class ?
Um .
Anyhow , boys and girls who did not perform well , you could say they were little hooligans , they were all mixed in together in that class , and there were also some who had problems at home .
Mm .
All of them , and every day I went there , and the classes were suspended , , so they did n't let me go to school , did n't let me go to class .
Mm .
So , afterward , I remember there was Mm . A guy in the engineering team , and he brought Quotations from Chairman Mao and said to me , He said , now take this , now take these Quotations from Chairman Mao and teach yourselves , and in the future you 'll take up arms and teach yourselves .
Lots of fun .
Mm .
So I was with this group of kids all together , and everybody copied everybody else and it was even harder to study .
In fact it was n't that we did n't study , I think it was ,
This class really helped me a lot , , sometimes in my life I think about this ,
Mm .
That period was both a happy and a fun time .
Because I was a good egg .
In this I go against the grain .
Um , the thing is , , they 're all the same .
If you 're bad , you do what you want , and so , you 're honest and so it 's easy to be free .
Plus when you yourself have already decided that you 're a bad kid , then , you achieve a kind of liberation , and you 're completely liberated and free .
I think that --
Um , of course today we say , at that time , um , in that class of ours , they were n't all necessarily bad kids .
Mm .
They just were n't like normal kids .
, it was like a brotherhood .
Ah , and we did some things that were out of bounds .
Mm , we helped each other .
Very sincere , very sincere and good .
When he was in that class , Ye Daying received patient teaching every day .
At that time he encountered the first love of his life that still remains fresh in his memory .
This girl became the only light in Ye Daying 's dark life for several years .
In those days if a middle school student liked a fellow - student , how did he go about expressing that ?
Um .
When I was a school kid , for example , Um , that girl , who ran the kitchen and was one of the better students in our class , I liked her .
Mm .
I always felt , um , she can , give you more on your plate , put more things on your plate for you to eat .
And then the most obvious way was um , to go see a movie together .
Mm .
It was ,
So already you could -- Go see a movie ; I thought ,
That was it , that was it .
You just want to go see the movie , you do n't worry about holding hands or not , um , and that was great , --
So you went to the movies with this girl ?
Yes .
Do you still remember what movies you saw ?
The Flower Girl .
I still remember that now .
Mm .
She cried as hard as she could .
So seeing The Flower Girl was the equivalent of seeing Titanic now .
Oh , yes , yes , a bit , a bit , yes , all was ready , no cry .
Yes , crying her eyes out , a big film like that .
At the time I thought I would n't cry .
But the people all around were crying , and I thought if I did n't cry it would look bad .
So then you cried .
So then I thought , I should let my emotions go .
Um , how was the girl , was she very pretty ?
, now I remember that she was very pretty , mm .
Mm .
She was a very good student .
Ha ha , this --
How was it she liked you ?
At that time we did n't talk about it , if two people gave each other the eye and felt it was right , then ,
Gave each other the eye , while you were in the class you gave each other the eye .
, so , when we were in class , for example you ,
I remember how it happened , yes .
Um . When we went to class , in the classroom , it was all very chaotic .
Mm .
Mm .
So then , we 'd each pick up a piece of chalk and toss the chalk back and forth . And throw spitballs .
I threw it at someone else but missed , and it hit her .
The result was that she turned her head to look .
And she looked at you angrily .
I thought , uh-oh , the expression in her eyes was like she would forgive you , that kind of feeling .
I thought wow , it 's so wonderful , that kind of feeling .
Mm .
That 's how it was , I should say .
It was like that ?
Mm .
Many years later , afterward , we graduated from senior middle school , and I was still going to see her .
Mm .
The --
, so we all took the exams for college , and things changed , right .
You graduated from middle school in '73 .
'74 .
Mm .
Graduated from midle school in '74 .
Mm , that female schoolmate went to the Shanghai suburbs to live and work .
Right , right , yes .
Ye Daying went to work in a factory ; at that time your monthly wages were , forty - some yuan ?
Mm , when I started it was a technical school .
Then at first it was 13 yuan , the first year 13 yuan ; the second year it was 15 yuan , and the third year it was 41 yuan .
Mm .
Mm .
41 yuan , at the time , for him , it was , an astronomical sum , um , a lot of money .
It was a lot of money .
In 1976 , there were two happy events in the Ye family .
The first was that his father , Ye Zhengming , was released and reunited with his family that he had been separated from for three years .
The second event was that Ye Daying had his 18th birthday and became an adult .
With the turn for the better in his father 's political circumstances , Ye Daying left behind his violent life and changed suddenly , becoming more inward - looking .
In 1978 the big news was that the college entrance exams would be reinstated nationwide , and people of Ye Daying 's age were thrilled .
However , at this time Ye Daying , facing this opportunity that would change his fortune , was at a loss as to what to do .
You thought those days were pretty good , did you not think about getting into the university ?
Oh my , in fact , '78 , for me , was an especially depressing time .
Mm .
Mm .
Up to then , um , I had never thought about the future .
Mm .
I thought everybody was the same , your fate settled things for you , um , you either go to a place live and work , or you became a -LRB- factory -RRB- worker .
In society , being a worker was already not so bad a thing , um , a way to move ahead .
Um , in '78 suddenly they reinstated the college entrance exams .
At that time , in '78 , I was 20 .
A lot of people were happy , very excited , because they reinstated the college entrance exams ; why were you feeling depressed ?
Right , but the problem was , , Because , I had never done well in school .
So right off I felt that I was finished , --
Those kids who were younger than us who had done well in school , , compared to me , they had a future , um , they could stand out .
Mm .
So I was hopeless , right off I was feeling down .
Very clearly a --
If you wanted to take the exams , what kind of score did you think you 'd get .
I did n't take the exams , I did n't have the nerve , I did n't try , so --
, the extraordinary thing was , at that time my mom was attending the film institute , she was an instructor there .
Mm .
Mm , I had n't thought , , that I would work in the movie .
Mm .
, um , she wanted to send the recruitment announcement to a friend 's house .
Mm .
So then I --
One day she sent me to deliver it , and so I picked it up and read it , and once I read it , oh ! The directing department of the film institute , inside , no language exams , no math or physics or chemistry exams , and I thought wow ! This is just the ticket .
Let 's run off to try and see .
I thought you 've loved movies ever since you were little , and then every day sitting in the movie theater you thought , I want to be a director .
No , I did n't , no .
It was just because there was no English exam , no exams in math or physics or chemistry .
Right , it was very simple .
Mm .
One more thing , because in '78 , the Beijing Film Institute was recruiting students in Shanghai --
Right .
So , Ye Daying went to take the exams for the film institute , but did n't pass the exams .
His mother , An Qi , had never thought that Ye Daying would sign up to take the exam for her work unit , the Beijing Film Institute .
But Ye Daying in fact failed when he took the reinstated exam .
Although it was the first time he had taken the exam , it left Ye Daying even more convinced that movies were something he could do .
The next year , 21 - year - old Ye Daying passed the entrance exam for the actors training class at the Xi'an Film Studio .
Being an actor was not his goal ; he hoped rather to get into the directing profession .
At that time you especially admired directors , right ?
Mm , because after I got to the Xi'an Film Studio , um , I discovered I had the shakes when I got on stage .
Mm .
Mm . Now , here chatting with you , I feel , um , it does n't matter .
Even today , in front of the lens , I 'm a nervous wreck .
Mm , very tense .
Did you act then ?
Of course , every day we had to , um , it was n't just recitation , so , doing sketches , this and that .
I thought , this is definitely not working .
Just getting on stage gave you the shakes .
Then , , no , it was n't my thing , this , I could n't find out why , and besides in those days ,
Um , it was in '80 that I went to the Xi'an Film Studio ,
Mm .
At that time , it was , always that kind of pompous stuff , or , that milquetoast kind of young male character , that kind of thing .
And I 'm not that kind of person , so I could n't get my bearings .
So then at the same time when I saw that Teng Wenji , he was probably thirty - some years old , he was the previous generation to us , very stubborn .
Mm .
Mm .
That projecting force of his , I thought wow , , that 's really good .
He could really project .
Because ultimately , there , I gradually realized this .
Mm .
And I would be in the audience and see him directing on site .
Mm .
Mm , I could see how they worked .
In fact in the beginning the attraction to movies was all these things , I thought it was really a bunch of fluff , I thought , that 's really fun , that 's really interesting .
I thought who was stubborn , then I wanted to be that kind of person , but that did n't mean I knew anything about that profession .
So no one ever came looking for you to do a play ?
At that time --
Mm , no one ever came looking -- .
They looked , but it was always just for an extra .
, you did n't even have any lines .
Mm .
That Xi'an Incident thing , I played an extra once .
There was a guy playing Zhang Xueliang , and I played his secretary going in to report to him , and I did it a few times but I was always in the wrong place .
What were your lines supposed to be ?
It was " reporting , a telegram " that sort of thing .
So you --
So I had never served as a soldier , that kind of pose , it was really awful .
So after I gave that up , no , it was not that kind of thing .
So the old director , Cheng Yin , um ,
Mm .
He would say , this is An Qi 's son , why is he like that ?
Do you remember how many takes you did ?
Oh , a lot .
I think it was something like ten plus times .
It was too , I 'd walk badly and turn like that .
, I attended that class for half a year , um , um and then I got sick .
Um , I got , , an inflammation of the central nervous system , so my whole body was paralyzed .
Your whole body was paralyzed ?
Right .
Your whole body was paralyzed ?
Right . I was paralyzed for ten months .
So you could n't move at all .
I could n't move at all .
When it started , my leg went numb , then my hand went numb , and then it started cross over , like that , and then slowly , slowly , slowly I could n't move .
What 's the scientific name of the disease ?
It 's called Guillain - Barre Syndrome .
It 's named after a foreigner .
Mm .
Ahem , if naming it somewhat common , it 's , a paralysis of the central nervous system , um , it goes from the nerve endings to the flesh , and , then it turns into myasthenia .
And how did you get better , later ?
Hormones .
You took hormones .
Um , , every day I had a transfusion .
Mm , after you get hormones , people may get very fat .
Mm .
Very fat .
I 'm so fat now , but compared to then it 's much better , in fact .
At that time how fat were you ?
Yah .
Getting so fat , it was this , if I looked down I could see my own cheeks , so I thought I was really fat .
What do you mean ?
If I just look down , my cheeks are right here .
But after they finished with the hormones , I gradually got better .
Mm .
The flesh all atrophied , um .
If you look at when I was in middle school , based on that bit of exercise --
Later , based on that , it all evaporated .
I 've heard it said that that Wang Shuo novel , which we later saw as a television play --
Sometimes , oh , right .
Mm .
Get some fun .
Get some fun .
The language in that , the part Wang Zhiwen played , the disease he got is about the same as your disease , is n't it ?
Right , right , right , right .
So sometimes , oh , it was me and Wang Shuo , together , it was , um , in '89 .
Mm , together , um , wrote a -- .
Aye , the script I wanted , the novel he wrote , um , that piece we created together .
Mm .
Therefore , at that time , we were talking and talking to shoot , an urban love story , tell a love story , so he took me , at that time , , more or less that story , as background .
Mm .
Then after I went back to Beijning , when we made arrangement and were eating together , I saw Wang Shuo for the first time
Then , when I saw him for the first time , Wang Shuo was holding a book in his arms , a book , that was Floating on the Sea , that novel he wrote , it was a sample .
Mm .
Gave it to me , and I took it back to school to read .
I read it and wow , that day , I thought he would be able --
Our generation could really find ourselves , I mean --
Um , in the end I knew we --
Why we studied movies , um , and why wrote things , expressing one 's own kind of thing is the most accurate person
Ye Daying had already read Wang Shuo 's novel Love the Hard Way , and the story and the style it was written in made a profound impression on him .
He sighed , this expresses what our generation really wants to express .
Later he was introduced by a friend , and Ye Daying met the author of the novel , Wang Shuo , at the film institute .
That was the beginning of their long friendship , which continues today .
How many plays did you collaborate on ?
Hi everyone /.
first up on the docket tonight we got an interview with the witness who led investigators to a landfill in the search for Natalee Holloway /.
He 's telling NBC news what and who he saw just days after Natalee 's May thirtieth disappearance /.
Also Natalee 's mother met with the lead prosecutor in the investigation today /.
And while the landfill continues to be searched and lead suspect Joran Van Der Sloot is interrogated for the fourth straight day by a team of behavioral specialists NBC 's Michelle Kosinski remains in Aruba /.
So Michelle the authorities really believe that uh this witness with regard to the landfill 's credible , do n't they /?
Well the authorities including the FBI we found out had checked this witness out early on just days after Natalee disappeared /.
And we just found out about this witness a couple weeks ago /.
That 's when his existence became widely known through private investigators and other sources /.
And it has been reported that he was afraid to come forward /.
Well it turns out he was just afraid for his identity to be known /.
but we learned that he came forward very quickly after he says he saw what happened in the landfill that day just days after it happened /.
He talked to police /.
He talked to the FBI /.
The FBI actually went out to that landfill with dogs looked around that area even before it became piled up with garbage /.
and they did n't find anything /.
It 's the EquuSearch volunteers who really said hey we believe this guy /.
His story does n't change /.
He seems to pan out /.
He seems to be a lucid guy /.
He seems to also be insistent that he saw something /.
So he says he saw some men drive up in a white pickup truck men that he says he later recognized to be the three suspects in this case /.
He says they took what looked like a body out of the back of the pickup truck /.
It was wrapped up in a bag /.
But when the wind blew he says he saw the upper part of a woman 's body blonde hair /.
and then he says they buried this body there in the landfill /.
Well over a period of weeks some ten feet of garbage has piled up /.
EquuSearch will tell you too that when they bring out dogs it 's very difficult for a dog to catch a scent in that landfill when they 're coming across things like medical waste /.
but they 're determined to keep going /.
He saw uh the woman 's body and inside a bag /.
Her hair was blowing out with the wind /.
And uh he did n't say this now /.
but he told that the back kind of came off and he saw half of the woman 's body /.
One of the most compelling reasons searchers say they believe this guy very much is that they say he gave them some clues as to things they would find buried deep within that garbage around that same area where he claims he saw a body things like a plastic pool /.
He said that there was a dirt road buried under all that garbage /.
Well they found those things and a couple of other items that he said would be there /.
The problem is they just have n't found any sign at all of Natalee Holloway /.
but they want to clear that place out and just feel satisfied that they looked as best they could because it 's disturbing /.
I mean his story has panned out in some ways /.
so they do n't want to give this up /.
Well that 's the question I have for you Michelle /.
So are you saying that the authorities uh looked into this guy 's story early on and they kind of pooh - poohed it and then EquuSearch came in a couple weeks later and said wait a sec , wait a sec , let 's give this guy a shot here and they followed up on it /?
Yeah pretty much /.
Uh the witness told us directly that in the beginning he felt like nobody was believing his story /.
But we talked to a high level source in law enforcement /.
and it turns out they did check it out /.
Hm /.
They sent the FBI out there with a dog /.
But EquuSearch says hey maybe we can do something more thoroughly here /.
We can bring out teams of dogs /.
But here 's the thing /.
They still have n't found one sign of her /.
but uh they are determined to keep it up through the weekend at least /.
Alright Michelle Kosinski as always thanks a lot /.
And as Michelle reported Natalee 's mother Beth Holloway Twitty met with the lead prosecutor in the investigation this afternoon Karin Janssen where she told Janssen about a girl came forward said she had an encounter with Joran Van Der Sloot the chief suspect /.
And on our program last night Beth told me the story /.
A beautiful eighteen year old blonde - headed girl from New Jersey um you know was able to recount an encounter that she had with Joran Van Der Sloot Deepak Kalpoe and Satish Kalpoe during the month of April oh five /.
And what did she say happened /?
you know it 's a pretty long scenario /.
We have a lot of details /.
Um you know the main thing to to sum it up as you know Joran how he entered this establishment /.
I believe that you know if you enter on the right side you have to have a valid ID /.
You enter Carlos N' Charlie 's on the left side you must have some type of I do n't know if it 's a VIP pass or what to enter /.
but Joran enters the establishment on the left side +approaches these group of tourist /.
Um you know it 's interesting how he is able to um try to work his way in and connect establish himself in uh Carlos N' Charlie 's /.
Was walking her around and these other tourists and was able to point out Satish and Deepak Kalpoe /.
They 're sitting ironically in the same corner the same stools that they were seated at in the picture that 's been all over international media /.
So that must be their spot where they wait while Joran is working /.
And um you know it was so interesting how everyone in the casino knew Joran /.
you know he knew everyone was greeting all the guys with this grip handshake /.
All the girls approach him with a kiss on the cheek /.
It was interesting how um you know he was able to order these group of girls by just merely leaning over the bar and ordering three shots of one fifty - one one for himself and three for the tourists with no money /.
So he 's got an open uh tab at Carlos N' Charlie 's /.
able to run a tab /.
And you know then you notice that in a evening 's proceeding he 's even approaching these girls getting close to closing time /.
Did /.
So that 's another unique pattern that he has /.
did she say uh anything about uh violence /?
No she did n't say anything about violence /.
but what I was looking for was a history is a predatory type behavior which I think Joran and Deepak and Satish have and how tightly connected the three are /.
Now i- /.
Joining me now is the private investigator who has been uh working with Natalee 's family TJ Ward and his associate Harold Phipps /.
Gentlemen thanks very much uh for coming on the program /.
+Appreciate it /.
Thank you /.
TJ let me start with you on this issue of this woman uh who came up uh to Beth /.
Have you been able to follow up on that /.
and how relevant do you think it is /?
Uh we have n't followed up with it /.
Um Beth and I have talked about it /.
and we will be following up on it uh here shortly /.
is it relevant /?
I mean a lot of my viewers wrote in saying alright so what /.
this guy 's a pickup artist /.
how does that really impact the case /?
Well it just shows it 's a pattern of um what his activity is when he hangs out at Carlos N' Charlie 's /.
I mean and trying to pick women up and take them from the bar and whatever he 's doing with them after that /.
But if there 's no violence associated with that does that help you in the investigation /?
Well again we do n't think there was a violent issue with him with Natalee /.
We think probably +something has happened to Natalee /.
and they panicked and then went forth and did what they were supposed to do /.
I mean there 's issues that 's come up /.
Um um well we feel something happened when Natalee was with them /.
What do you mean by that /?
Either she either passed out regurgitated /.
um something had happened /.
And on top of that now there 's a statement that 's come up from Joran Van Der Sloot that he 's given to the police uh one of twenty - two statements he 's given by the way that um Deepak had uh raped her and killed her on the beach /.
So at this point what the police have you know again we 're unaware because we 're not getting any information from law enforcement /.
so we have to go on the course of information that we 're gathering on behalf of the family /.
Well let me ask Harold how do you all know that /?
I mean that information for example about that particular statement that TJ was just mentioning /.
How do we know that /?
Yeah how do you know that that statement was actually made by Joran Van Der Sloot /?
Oh we do n't /.
This is the statements that were being attributed to us on those /.
Uh since we have n't interviewed Joran we do n't know exactly what he has said /.
but some of that statement has been let out /.
and uh through a chain of different individuals uh uh they have told us uh what the statement was /.
TJ just so I 'm clear where are you getting that from that that statement was made by Joran about Deepak /?
I have seen a copy of the statement from one of the local newspapers here um Diario /.
Um Jossy Mansur produced and showed me a copy of that statement that uh Joran Van Der Sloot made um the last time that I was here in Aruba /.
and uh he conveyed it from Dutch into English and uh showed me the statement /.
Uh TJ are you in any trouble there /?
I mean there 's been a lot of discussions about the authorities getting uh annoyed about you knocking on doors and things like that /.
Well it 's not that /.
Um there was some /.
the Aruban authorities /-
and we 've had conversations about this /.
This is squared away /.
It 's been straightened out /.
Um there was uh some evidence that leaked out to the fact that had an arrest warrant for my arrest on Wednesday and that I was working without a work permit and I was going to be deported by law enforcement and Wednesday night the law enforcement was looking for me to arrest me /.
Uh all that is untrue /.
and I want to make that perfectly clear /.
Uh this was brought up by another media station here on the island that uh made claim to that /.
but I can to assure /.
Alright /.
It 's not true /.
We 'll move on /.
Alright /.
Yes /.
Alright /.
Um uh Harold finally this landfill /.
Uh are you hopeful uh that EquuSearch is going to find something /?
How credible do you think that witness is who says that he saw three men dumping what looked like a blonde body /?
Well uh as a retired FBI agent I 'm always hopeful for an outcome /.
Uh we interviewed the individual at length /.
and having experienced hundreds if not thousands of interviews during my thirty - one years uh this guy was very uh online /.
He did n't go mm ah /.
I mean he was like telling a story /.
and it did n't appear to me at all like he was coached or practiced /.
Mhm /.
He just told a story uh from the beginning to the end /.
and I believe him /.
I think there was something there /.
if there is the body , whether it 's still there is another story /.
Mhm /.
There has been uh a period of time since then /.
and it could have been removed again /.
But uh his story I think is credible /.
We also had a /-
TJ /.
Sorry go ahead /.
finish up Harold /.
No go ahead /.
I was just going to a- /-
I 'm out of time /.
I was going to ask TJ bottom line do you think that you 're going to be able to crack the case in the next uh couple weeks /?
Well it depends /.
I believe that law enforcement uh since the FBI 's been here has been working very credibly /.
Mhm /.
And uh I believe that they have something um that 's probably solid enough and hopeful uh come September fourth that Joran Van Sloot will stay where he 's positioned right now /.
Mhm /.
and that there 'll be additional arrests in this matter from uh parties and individuals that waited we already know that are possibly involved in this disappearance /.
Alright /.
TJ Ward and Harold Phipps thanks a lot guys for taking the time /.
Really appreciate it /.
Coming up two former jurors in the Michael Jackson case writing tell - all books about the case /.
They now apparently say Jackson is guilty /.
and they 're apparently saying that they broke all kinds of rules in the jury room sneaking in tapes of news reports /.
An insider on the new books joins me next /.
And it 's been a month since this man went missing on a honeymoon on a Mediterranean cruise /.
Police now looking into three men who might 've had something to do with his disappearance /.
maybe foul play /.
And our weeklong series Manhunt Sex Offenders on the Loose wraps up tonight /.
We 're trying to get these guys before they strike again /.
We 'll check in with Erin Runnion five year old daughter Samantha raped and killed by a sex offender /.
Your email abrams report at MSNBC dot com /.
Please include your name where you 're writing from /.
I respond at the end of the show /.
New York Daily News today reports that jurors are saying there were all sorts of shannanigans going on in the jury room at the Michael Jackson case , that a juror wanted to convict Jackson smuggled in a medical dictionary to prove Jackson fits the definition of a pedophile /.
She was later she says intimidated into changing her vote to not guilty /.
Same juror we told you about yesterday Eleanor Cook who 's reportedly writing a tell - all book titled Guilty as Sin Free as a Bird /.
News also reports another allegation that quote another juror sneaked a forbidden video of Court TV broadcast featuring the prosecution friendly Dianne Dimond and Nancy Grace to the jury room but a faulty VCR prevented a sneak peak /.
And then a quote gang of three female jurors were such rabid Jackson fans that they cooed not my Michael when the panel discussed the felony charges against the pop idol /.
Yikes /.
Stacy Brown MSNBC analyst author of Michael Jackson the Man Behind the Mask and a name who keeps popping up with all these books /.
Stacy are you writing any of these books first of all /?
No I 'm not /.
Alright /.
But you actually talked to these jurors about writing a book /.
That 's correct /.
Alright /.
and you were approached alright /.
I was approached /.
And so they are saying the things that the Daily News reports , are they not /?
Well they are saying a lot more than just that /.
What else they saying /?
Um well eh let 's just clear up with the medical book /.
She did n't actually bring it into the deliberation room /.
the jurors were meeting /.
They rendezvoused at a juvenile hall in Santa Maria /.
and she bought it there /.
and as they were getting into the van they ordered it to put it back in her car /.
but she wanted them to understand Ellie Cook this is that this fits Michael to a tee /.
So she wanted them to know Michael Jackson 's guilty , he 's a pedophile /.
and then what /?
Then she just caved /?
She says she was pressured /.
Think she was threated /.
and they were threatening to throw her off the jury /.
Come on /.
this is the one who 's been wanting to write a book since the beginning , right /?
Yeah absolutely /.
Her granddaughter had put out feelers since she was picked for the jury /.
What other kind of shannigans were going on back there , do they say /?
Well um they mentioned um as you had mentioned in your open about the Court TV video /.
Someone had apparently taped some Court TV um stuff /.
and they tried to play it /.
Uh apparently it was a malfunction in the video tape /.
Mhm /.
Well let me give the juror 's explanation for this /.
And /.
This is Paula Coccoz /.
we talked to her today juror number ten /.
It 's number four /.
Uh the bailiff brought in a TV with a VCR so we could review the sheriff 's interview /.
and we went to put in the tape /.
The tape was marked Court TV /.
The people at the courthouse had left this tape in the VCR /.
We told the bailiff about this /.
and he seemed concerned about whether or not we reviewed the tape /.
We told them we did n't watch it /.
We did n't find out until later what was on the tape /.
Yeah /.
according to Ellie though someone taped that show /.
It was n't left there /.
Um and there was a problem /.
Now I know that someone else mentioned that there was a problem as well with a VCR /.
but if you remember well the interview with the sheriff and the young boy was on a disk and not a VCR /.
And this is number five /.
Uh this is again the Daily News /.
That Cook uh admits that she frequently winked at Jackson 's mother um Katherine in court and exchanged wardrobe tips with the entertainer 's mom which resulted in them wearing the same colors on certain days /.
Ellie Cook talked about that yeah /.
She mentioned that they would wink and nod at each other /.
I do n't understand /.
So on the one hand this juror 's saying I was convinced he was guilty you know /.
and they 're saying oh she was trying to bring in a medical text /.
and on the other hand she 's sitting there winking at Katherine Jackson talking to her about what clothes they 're going to wear /.
Saying everything was going to be okay /.
She /-
And that 's why you did n't believe this story /.
That 's why I do n't yeah ah /.
That 's why you would n't write the book /.
I 'm not writing it because I just think that there 's a lot of issues with this /.
if you felt that this guy was guilty , you felt he was a pedophile , he lives in your community , he 's a very powerful member of your community why let him free then /?
Do you just not believe these jurors /?
Is that the problem /?
I just do n't believe them /.
Why /?
I mean they 're making this up for money /?
It 's just /-
well uh you know I think in both their cases they feel now in retrospect maybe we made a mistake /.
And see I can live with that if that 's what they are saying /.
but they 're not saying that /.
They 're saying that they believed all along he was guilty /.
and I 'm having a hard time with that /.
Alright Stacy uh stick around for a minute /.
Joining me now NBC News legal analyst former prosecutor Susan Filan and attorney and Celebrity Justice executive producer Harvey Levin criminal defense attorney Daniel Horowitz /.
Harv what do you make of /-
Look you 've followed this close /.
What do you make of all this /?
Well I think Eleanor Cook is a wacko Dan /.
and I think if any of these allegations are true these jurors need to be prosecuted /.
I mean this is jury tampering from within the jury if these allegations are true /.
And if there is ever to be a fair celebrity trial again especially in California somebody needs to say look we are drawing the line /.
You 're not going to get books at the end of the rainbow and do things inappropriate /.
If it pans out it 's true I think Tom Sneddon himself should prosecute without respect to whether it would have been pro or anti Michael Jackson /.
So Susan let 's assume for a minute it 's true /.
Again you 're the prosecutor /.
and you 're sitting there going are you kidding me /?
There were two or three jurors who wanted to convict /.
and they caved because they were pressured or whatever /.
You ca n't do anything , can you /?
Nothing /.
eh game over /.
You ca n't take an appeal from an aquittal /.
The problem that I have with this is as members of the media we had an awfully difficult time with access to this trial /.
If this is going to set a precedent to shut media out because these highly publicized celebrity trials yield these faulty verdicts she 's doing far far more harm than she could ever understand /.
Yeah but let 's forget about the media stuff /.
I mean the bottom line is the prosecutors ca n't do anything about this , right /?
I mean if the jurors were tampering with evidence , if they were playing with evidence et cetera back there the prosecutors have to just suck it up and be depressed /.
There 's no remedy /.
They have to eat it /.
It 's over /.
Daniel I mean Stacy does n't really believe them /.
but what do you think /?
Well Dan I believe them /.
You know jurors are people /.
We expect them to be perfect little robots doing what the judge says /.
and they do n't /.
They 're going to watch television /.
I 'm sure they all watch your show /.
and they watched Susan try to convict Michael Jackson /.
but then I hope they listened to me and to reason /.
But the bottom line is they reached a fair and just verdict /.
You have to trust people and nail those attempts to control and hypercontrol this case /.
Just backfired /.
It made the jurors feel isolated /.
and now they 're all quiet /.
They wo n't talk to us about what really went on /.
Okay here 's my problem /.
It 's this woman saying she was forced and bullied right into reaching the verdict that she did /.
and there she is saying I did n't like the way that this woman snapped at me talking about the accuser 's mother et cetera /. /.
You know Dan I do n't even talk to juries afterwards unless I win because you 're always going to hear things like that /.
People in a jury room are in a bar room brawl /.
It 's not supposed to be pretty /.
and when it 's over there 's always second thoughts and regrets /.
but it 's the system /.
and it works /.
Harvey you know what /.
eh hey hey if I may say /-
But Dan your point is that /-
You know a bar room brawl is one thing /.
They were acting like outlaws if these allegations are true /.
Right /.
And you know I agree Susan that the prosecutors ca n't do anything to Michael Jackson /.
but they certainly can do something to the jurors /.
and I think it is more important right now to say /-
I 'm telling you Dan you and I have covered a lot of trials in this city /.
and we 've seen a lot of weird things happen since OJ Simpson with books and everything else /.
If jurors realize that there 's a back end if you will which is a Hollywood term to these trials and if they get caught so what they get caught but they can still publish a book if they believe that everything is going to change in this city /.
let me ask you /.
Harv here 's the thing that I do n't understand /.
And this is why Stacy made the right call on this /.
Alright Stacy may say he did n't believe them whatever /.
I do n't think that many people are going to buy this book /.
Is that Stacy /?
I did n't either /.
Is that the real reason you did n't want to write the book Stacy /?
Well no no that 's not the b- /-
You did n't think you were going to make any money /?
Come on /.
That 's the real reason , is n't it /?
No /.
the real reason is Dan believe it or not I have a conscience /.
I wrote Man Behind the Mask with Bob Jones because I believed in Bob Jones /.
and I still believe in the material /.
I do n't believe in this material /.
uh Harvey do you agree with me that the book 's not really going to sell much /?
Absolutely /.
For two reasons /.
Number one I think it would have been a better book if he would have been found guilty /.
And secondly I think the credibility of the authors um mean a whole lot /.
and eh you know I just think everything is so off - kilter people are n't going to be particularly interested in it /.
Yes /.
Yeah /.
Uh reminder /.
you can hear from uh those two jurors who now say Jackson 's guilty premiere of Rita Cosby Live and Direct Monday night at nine PM eastern right here on MSNBC /. /.
Susan Filan 's going to stick around /.
Harv Daniel Horowitz thanks a lot /.
appreciate it /.
Coming up no clear explanation for what happened to a honeymooner who disappeared from a Mediterranean cruise last month /.
Police now focusing on three men seem to be telling some inconsistent stories /.
And our series on wanted sex offenders around the country concludes tonight /.
It 's called Manhunt Sex Offenders on the Loose /.
College student Dru Sjodin allegedly raped and murdered by a sex offender two years ago /.
Her mother joins us along with Erin Runnion whose five year old girl was raped and murdered by a convicted sex offender /.
Coming up , man disappears on his honeymoon cruise ship /.
Police on the case focusing now on three men seem to be telling some inconsistent stories /.
More on the investigation coming up /.
but first the headlines /.
Hello I 'm Milissa Rehberger /.
Here 's what 's happening /.
The Russian military is racing to rescue seven sailors trapped in a minisubmarine six hundred and twenty - five feet below the surface of the Pacific Ocean /.
The sub got snagged in a giant fishing net /.
A US Airforce jet carrying robotic undersea vehicles is on its way from California to aid in that rescue /.
It 's expected to arrive in ten to twelve hours /.
It is unclear how much oxygen remains onboard that minisub /.
The Russian Navy 's chief spokesperson says there may only be about twelve hours worth while another official says there 's more than twenty - four hours left /.
British Prime Minister Tony Blair announced the crackdown on terrorists and extremists in the wake of the London bombing /.
He proposed new deportation measures against people who advocate violence /.
And a new anti-insurgents operation underway in western Iraq /.
US marines and Iraqi troops launched Operation Quick Strike in the Euphrates River Valley /.
That is northwest of Baghdad /.
That 's where twenty - two marines were killed this week /.
Back to the Abrams Report /.
Exactly a month after twenty - six year old George Smith vanished from a Royal Caribbean ship cruising in the Mediterranean NBC News has learned federal investigators are now focusing on three men who were traveling on the cruise ship called Brilliance of the Seas two Russian brothers who live in Brooklyn and one man who lives in California /.
The attorney for the California man issued this statement /.
We 've been cooperating with the FBI and the US Attorney 's Office in their investigation /.
and we 'll continue to do so /.
However we 've been asked by the authorities not to speak with the media while the investigation is pending /.
and we intend to honor that request /.
This photo taken the day shows what appears to be blood on the awning below the cabin where Smith and his wife were staying /.
Smith was traveling on his honeymoon and had left Barcelona Spain on June twenty - ninth /.
what was meant to be a twelve day cruise /.
Halfway through the trip on the morning of July fifth he disappeared /.
He was reported missing later that day when the ship docked in Kusadasi Turkey /.
NBC has also learned that Smith 's new wife Jennifer Hagel has been questioned is not a suspect /.
Two were married on June twenty - fifth in Newport Rhode Island /.
Joining me now former Connecticut prosecutor NBC News uh legal analyst Susan Filan who 's been covering the case closely and Orlando police chief Walter uh Zalisko who was on the same cruise that Smith travelled on as well as forensic expert Larry Kobilinsky /.
Alright so Susan what do you know about the investigation /?
Well NBC news has learned from a law enforcement source that the wife is not a suspect and that they are focusing in on these two Russian brothers as you said who live in Brooklyn /.
The California teen is apparently the key to the case at this point /.
That 's law enforcement 's focus /.
If this young man will talk this could break open what happened to George /.
The key question is is this a tragic accident or is this foul play /?
Right now law enforcement seems to think it 's foul play /.
US attorney Kevin O'Connor said we have reason to believe there could have been foul play here /.
Um alright uh Mister Zalisko do you know anything from your personal experience of having been on the cruise as to what happened /?
Uh good evening sir /.
Uh first I 'd just like to clarify I 'm a police chief in Oak Hill Florida not Orlando /.
Uh now as far as the cruise uh I was on the cruise that uh uh day /.
and the way I became aware of what occured was that uh the morning of the fifth a relative of mine had mentioned that there was blood stain on the canopy beneath her uh balcony /.
at that point we kind of dismissed it /.
We did n't know what was uh going on /.
Uh we then went on our daily excursion /.
However later on into the cruise that day uh the ship 's captain went onto the PA system and made an announcement that uh authorities were on the ship and they were investigating the possibility that an individual had gone overboard during the night or early morning hours /.
When I asked my cousin the uh size of the blood splatter she had indicated it was relatively the size of a small uh dog of a beagle type /.
However viewing those photographs on TV that blood splatter is much larger than uh a small dog /.
Mhm /.
In fact it 's maybe three to four feet in length /.
And then we 've been hearing many stories that uh there were a lot of people going into and out of the state rooms uh which would indicate that the crime scene was not properly secured in the early stages of the investigation /.
Well /.
Alright let me play this piece of sound from one of the passengers who was uh staying right nearby uh this particular uh room /.
We were awakened uh about four in the morning uh by loud yelling coming from the cabin /.
Um it sounded like people uh cheering uh like a drinking contest type thing /.
And he says uh later um chief that he heard a horrific thud /.
Well yeah that would indicate that something did go on there /.
and we know uh that the three individuals were in a room uh with Mister Smith /.
And the question that has to be uh presented to everybody is why is it taking so long for authorities to interview the individual that was in a cabin next door /?
Mhm /.
Any seasoned investigator would know that you would want to conduct your interviews uh of possible witnesses immediately after the crime /.
Yeah /.
Yeah /.
And you would not just interview that individual next door /.
You would have to take a step to interview people above below and to both sides /.
Susan what 's the answer to that /?
But Dan /.
there are jurisdictional problems here /.
You know it 's not a clear cut case as to who gets to prosecute this case /.
Turkey ca n't do anything without a body /.
United States can /.
Fair play of the United States for stepping in /.
fair play to law enforcement for getting involved /.
Jurisdiction is n't clear /.
but they 're working very hard to solve the crime /.
I do n't think the criticism is well placed against law enforcement in this case /.
Also the crime scene oh if you want to call it that was cleaned up by the cruise ship who got their investigators and their lawyers in from what I understand right away to make this go away /.
so I think law enforcement was put in a bad position trying to play catchup /.
and I think they 're doing +an amazing job /.
Larry so uh any chance now based on the fact that things have been cleaned up et cetera to get any usable evidence /?
Well it 's very difficult Dan /.
Uh obviously as we keep saying we do not have a body /.
therefore we do not have a cause or a manner of the death /.
But we do have some physical evidence /.
Unfortunately examination of the photograph uh tells me it was not done the proper way /.
It was n't a forensic photograph /.
So I really do not know how large the stain was in its dimensions /.
but it is pretty clear that there 's a lot of blood there great deal of blood /.
It makes you think that something criminal occured /.
But again getting back to how you solve the crime you got to go to the crime scene /.
and I think there are multiple scenes here /.
Every place there 's blood it 's a crime scene /.
But the most important place is the cabin because that 's presumably where the injury took place /.
Now there was some rumor about some arguments going casino the night before /.
Uh and it could very well be that he was arguing with these individuals /.
so uh that could be the tie the connection /.
and I think good policework would connect the individuals in question with the casino with Mister Smith /.
and that might help us understand what happened /.
this is um a little bit more sound /.
This is again from Cletus Hyman uh who was literally um in a joining or nearby cabin um as to what he heard around he said four in the morning the day before uh Mister Smith went missing /.
At times it sounded like furniture was being actually picked up and dropped /.
and then that horrific uh thud /.
Yeah I mean that sure sounds to me chief like we 're not talking about someone who /-
I mean I guess it 's possible if you 're talking about loud yelling coming /-
Well look if this guy 's right that loud yelling is coming from the cabin right and the wife is not a real suspect here means that there was probably someone else in there /.
Well there absolutely was someone else in that room /.
And what 's interesting is there was a witness who uh had informed ship 's authorities that she had heard a scream uh early that morning /.
And what 's really interesting is uh we do n't know if she 's been interviewed at this point /.
But it was five days later that the ship 's attorneys had begun to question her not law enforcement but ship 's attorneys /.
We will uh continue to follow this /.
Chief Zalisko of the Oakhill Police Department sorry about that Susan Filan Larry Kobilinsky thanks a lot /.
Coming up two mothers both their daughters kidnapped raped killed /.
Join us for the final installment of our series Manhunt Sex Offenders on the Loose /.
And you know I sort of pooh - poohed the idea that two jurors from the Michael Jackson trial are now writing tell - all books saying that they think Michael Jackson 's guilty /.

Coming up , our series Manhunt Sex Offenders on the Loose continues with two mothers who lost very loved ones to really these monsters , coming up /.
All week we 've been continuing with our series Manhunt Sex Offenders on the Loose /.
In a moment I 'm going to talk with two very courageous mothers who both lost daughters to sex offenders /.
But first I want to highlight some of the wanted sex offenders running free before they strike /.
This time in New York state /.
Tomas Meddaugh is a oh he 's not thirty that guy 's what fifty alright fifty year old white male five foot seven a hundred and sixty - eight pounds with scars near his left eyebrow and shoulder his neck and abdomen /.
He 's got a prior conviction for rape /.
and his current offense involved deviant sexual intercourse with a thirteen year old girl /.
He 's considered armed and dangerous /.
Francisco Paulino is a forty - six year old Hispanic male five foot nine hundred and forty no scars or tattoos that they know of /.
He does have a prior conviction for the knifepoint rape of a fourteen year old girl /.
He 's violated his parole /.
He 's wanted /.
Dion Bryant twenty - four year old black male standing five foot six one fifty - six /.
Convicted for attempted rape /.
three underage girls involved /.
He too has violated his parole /.
Wanted /.
Anyone with information about their whereabouts should call New York 's a hundred most wanted tipline one eight hundred two six two four three two one and keep in mind that these guys really may be dangerous /.
so /-
Now the women you 're about to meet lost their children to vicious predators /.
Samantha Runnion was uh just eleven days away from her sixth birthday when she was kidnapped sexually assaulted and murdered by a man named Alejandro Avila /.
He 's been sentenced to death for those crimes /.
In choosing to destroy Samantha 's life you chose this /.
You chose to waste your life to satisfy a selfish and sick desire /.
You knew it was wrong /.
and you chose not to think about it /.
Well now you have a lot of time to think about it /.
Do n't waste it /.
Write it down so that the rest of us can figure out how to stop you people /.
You 're a disgrace to the human race /.
And Dru Sjodin was a twenty - two year old college student /.
She was abducted and killed /.
Alfonso Rodriguez a man with prior convictions for assaulting women is facing trial accused of kidnapping and murder /.
Convicted he too uh could get the death penalty /.
Joining me now is Samantha Runnion 's mother Erin Runnion and Dru Sjodin 's mother Linda Walker /.
Thanks so much uh for coming on the program /.
We appreciate it /.
Alright Erin let me start with you /.
What do you think the biggest problem is out there when it comes to these sex offenders /?
Well I think that there 's a gross misconception about sex offender crimes /.
I think most do not realize how pervasive the problem is /.
The sex offenders that we have caught are a very small percentage of those that are out there /.
Statistically one in four girls and as many as one in six to ten boys are sexually assaulted before they are eighteen /.
That 's nationwide /.
This problem is much bigger than I think people are realizing /.
And Linda I guess what we 're realizing as we have been highlighting these wanted sex offenders around the country is how many of them are still out there and wanted /.
Well currently there 's um right now uh over a hundred thousand that are missing /.
Unbelievable /.
Uh we know that there 's over five hundred thousand registered /.
So yes there 's a vast amount that are running uh through the system /.
That 's a May of two thousand five um statistic /.
but as far as those before that time and date /.
Um Linda eh how much has this eh when I say changed your life I mean in addition to the obvious loss of your daughter but in terms of what you are doing everyday with your life /.
both of you have devoted much of your lives to this cause now /.
Linda why do n't you tell me a little bit about what you 've been doing /.
Well um I 've been working with um er pardon me Byron Dorgan Senator of North Dakota /.
um working legislation on what has been uh called Dru 's Law which we hope will be a national sex +offender uh database through computer /.
And um obviously we know that this nation is more and um they 're able to access cross you know state lines /.
so I think it 's important that uh people of predators living amongst us across you know the country and be vigilant uh besides uh leaving the pressure on them /.
Mhm /.
Yeah /.
Erin uh every time I listen to that tape of you um talking to uh your dau- I get chills /.
Um was it at all uh cathartic for you to be able to stand across from him /?
Definitely /.
Definitely I to say what I said to him /.
I needed to address him /.
And I feel like I got it off my chest you know /.
I hope to never ever see him again /.
The whole trial process is really built around the defendant /.
and um it was very important to me that I bring it back around and make it about Samantha because that 's what it was really about /.
Do you watch these other stories uh in the news /.
and does it just get your blood boiling as you see eh these cases where was on the loose should have been arrested could 've been /.
You know the technology is there /.
so yes it infuriates me /.
I ca n't understand why we 're so behind in terms of tracking sex offenders /.
and I really think it 's because people do n't real- /-
there 's no reason that there should n't be a nationwide movement to stop these people . To have them register at the very least have them their driver 's licenses /.
If they do n't they go on a most wanted list /.
it 's made public nationwide /.
At the very least every state could do that /.
it adds to state revenue /.
it does n't take away /.
It 's a good way to track them /.
And I have to just on a personal note applaud Linda /.
I met her before they had found Dru /.
and I 'm so sorry for your loss /.
I think you 're just amazing /.
You 're doing such a job /.
Well as well for you too /.
Thank you /.
Linda are you psychologically prepared uh for this trial /?
I mean eh you know you can tell from seeing on that tape that obviously it 's not easy stuff /.
I mean to sit there next to these guys /.
You know it 's just another part of this whole sick story /.
there 's no script for it /.
I do n't know if anyone could ever be prepared /.
Um obviously it 's something that um we look to have it put behind us so we can really dwell more on what Dru gave us in her life and not how tragically she was taken from us /.
And also I have to say that what both of you are doing in working with legislators uh to move forward uh to not just say we 're going to only look past /.
Both of you are doing /.
and that 's why we 're so um glad and proud to have you both on the program /.
It 's because of what both of you are doing to have things change /.
um and I think that is what 's /-
Go ahead Linda /.
Well and uh thanks goes to you and to the media to help us /.
Absolutely /.
Obviously we could n't scream loud enough uh to bring the attention /.
so our hat is off to all of you as well /.
Yeah /.
Yeah and that 's /-
And to realize you know why we 're out here doing what we 're doing on the scale that we 're able to /.
and that 's why I have to tell you on this special series we 're doing I 'm just getting so tired of hearing these stories about these guys where they were always on the loose and people say oh you know it would have been nice if he was captured /.
Tired of it /.
and as a result you know we 're doing the little bit that we can /.
but you guys are the ones who are really going to get things done /.
Your voices your presence um I think is really the difference /.
and that 's why I thank you both so much for coming on the program /.
Well thank you /.
Well thank you /.
it 's /.
And you know it 's so important we know too /.
Absolutely /.
Absolutely /.
It 's so important that people realize at home that in our own homes in our own lives we can work to prevent these crimes /.
It is really just about uh communicating with neighbors getting a watch going in your community talking /-
Report every suspicious behavior there is /.
You never know /.
It leads to convictions time and time again /.
and Linda Walker thank you both so much for coming on the program /.
Absolutely uh /.
Thank you /.
We really appreciate it /.
Be right back /.
Thank you /.
Thank you Dan /.
I 've had my say /.
now it 's time for your rebuttal /.
Last night I said if the two jurors in the Michael Jackson case are really now saying that he 's guilty that 's shameful /.
Leslie Birdwhistell from Bowling Green Kentucky /.
Man you /.
Ca n't these people step away from the trial and the ten other jurors take in some information that was not presented in court and change their minds about the verdict /?
Uh No /.
It 's too important /.
They saw the evidence /.
The only thing that might 've changed their minds this quickly I think is money or peer pressure neither of which are very good reasons /.
David Becker from Bradenton Florida /.
Why 's it so difficult to believe these jurors believed Michael Jackson was guilty but did n't believe there was sufficient evidence to convict /?
Uh maybe Dave /.
but the Daily News reported that they quote flip - flopped /.
And in our weeklong series Manhunt Sex Offenders on the Loose trying to stop wanted sex offenders before they strike Chris O'Rourke from Gardner Massachusetts /.
I 'm happy that someone 's finally trying to do something to ward off these child attacks before rather than focus on them after /.
from West Hollywood Californ- /-
Dan I know your intentions are good /.
but your drive to stop sex offenders before they commit a crime sounds a bit like a southern lynch mob in the sixties /.
Really /.
it 's a lynch mob mentality to want to find wanted sex offenders /.
Your emails Abrams Report one word at MSNBC dot com /.
we go through them at the end of the show /.
Coming up , how one penny pinching motorist thought he was getting back at the cop who gave him a speeding ticket /.
Did n't really work /.
Our Oh Please is up next /.
Oh please you ever wondered how to get back at the police for writing you a speeding ticket /?
One man in Moorhead Minnesota thought he could do just that by finding good use for all /-
The driver paid for the one hundred and twenty dollar ticket with twelve thousand pennies /.
Seattle man was issued a speeding citation for driving seventy in a fifty mile per hour zone /.
Speedster showed up to court hauling a small garbage can full of pennies /.
Court had the final laugh though making the guy wait at court until every was counted offsite at a bank /.
That does it for us tonight /.
Coming up next Hardball with Chris Matthews /.
Have a great weekend /.
We got a big week next week /.
so we 'll see you /.
Should the peace include military reservists /?
And why wo n't they let Bob Novak speak /?
Let 's play Hardball /.

Title : The Story of Teeth -LRB- 6 -RRB- .
Originating site : BBS Unknown Space -LRB- Thu Jan 25 21:38:45 2007 -RRB- .
I have kept the good habit of having my teeth cleaned ever since I knew it could claim my life if I abruptly go to clean my teeth after years of leaving them uncleaned .
After my still upright but " left - tilting " teeth crouched in my mouth safely and soundly for another two years , another revolution erupted half a year after I graduated and found a job .
The revolution could be said a rudimentary one , which made me decide eventually to eliminate all the betrayers and heretics in one action !.
The incident was caused by a molar .
The location of the tooth was just next to the broken wisdom tooth that led to my first visit to an American dentist .
For some unknown reason , when I was eating the other day , the tooth suddenly ached during the meal , and it was very painful .
Unexpected I heard a " crack " while I was eating , and part of the tooth fell off !.
I could not remember eating anything hard ?!.
I rushed to the dentist , who said root canal therapy upon seeing it , your dental nerve had come out !.
I did not know what root canal meant but thought the name was quite fancy .
It was after I began to receive it that I found it really painful !.
For example killing the nerves , and dealing with the dental crown ...
I asked the dentist then why my tooth broke .
After examining my 25 teeth , the dentist told me seriously that the teeth on the right side were somewhat " cross biting " due to the " parallel shift " of my teeth , such that the upper and lower right teeth were always against each other .
The wrong position had led to uneven abrasions , resulting in the broken tooth .
I asked what solutions are available ?
The dentist said " correction . "
Thus , three years after I ran away from the " brigand orthodontist , " I stepped into the orthodontist 's office again ...

Guo Kai 's Economic Notes : Your uncle is just your uncle .
Guo Kai 's Economic Notes
This morning I went to the supermarket with Dad , and when it came time to check out I discovered something that everybody probably knows : not everybody buys the same things .
Of course this is a no - brainer , but this is actually a major problem faced by me and many other people whenever we discuss economic issues or economic phenomena .
Most of the time , economic policy and economic theory are not aimed at individuals .
In terms of probability , if you explain the behavior of a specific individual , for example your uncle , using any economic theory , the probability that it will be accurate is virtually 0 .
In fact , in the great majority of cases the economic theory is aimed at an entire group , or a subgroup .
In terms of averages , accuracy is the goal of many economic theories -LRB- here I 'm being inaccurate ; I hope the experts will not take it too literally , especially those with IO expertise -RRB- .
But with regard to an ordinary person , he may never see the whole group , he sees only his co-workers , his relatives and his friends , the group of people familiar to him ; add up all the people in this group and they may number 200 , and that is already a lot of people .
Below I am going to refer to these 200 people collectively as " his uncle . "
So whenever you discuss an economic theory with someone , the response of a perfectly ordinary person would be : My uncle is n't like that , so this theory is baloney .
In other words , everybody tends to mistake the part for the whole .
Here , mistaking the part for the whole is not derogatory ; it is a limitation of the human race itself ; you have it and I have it .
If Americans had learned not to mistake the part for the whole , they might not have made such a mess of the world .
I believe that they made such a complete mess of the Middle East to a very large extent because they applied their own common sense to understanding the Middle East , which is a completely different place from the United States .
On this issue , China does not have much basis for being self - congratulatory ; China 's rapid rise has even caused some people to have a sort of misconception - that whatever China does is right - and this is in fact a manifestation of narrow - mindedness .
Therefore I believe it is extremely important to recognize that one 's own knowledge has limitations .
We need to maintain a sufficiently open attitude toward things that do n't correspond to our common sense .
So just because every time your uncle goes to the supermarket he buys hog head meat does n't mean that we should immediately assume that any theory that does not predict people going to the supermarket will buy hog head meat is wrong .
When you feel other people are talking baloney , and what other people say does not correspond to your " common sense , " you should at the same time recognize that your uncle is only your uncle , he is not the whole world .
What type of skin fits for beautification ?
Beauty Lover
-- Shock treatments can easily make you hypersensitive ; for getting rid of blemishes it 's best to go to the hospital .
In the public 's eyes , the beauty industry has always been both praised and blamed : on the one hand , it meets everybody 's demand for beauty , but on the other , after much major work on the face , many people feel that the results are limited , and in extreme cases the result is n't beauty but disfigurement .
Why is this ?
In the view of clinical dermatologists , the results at beauty salons are not obvious and there may even be problems .
In fact because not only is the consumer unlucky , not choosing the right beauty salon , but to a great extent this is determined by whether they choose the right occasion for beautification and understand the results .

Qingqing 20070107 .
bill shen
Cloudy , temperature approx. 2 degrees .
While Qingqing was rinsing her mouth for the second time last night , mom said : leaks air and leaks rain .
Qingqing was unhappy upon hearing that .
She pounded mom with her little fists .
Dad also scolded mom : you also leaked air and leaked rain while your permanent teeth grew in your childhood .
Qingqing looked at Mom with water in the mouth .
At last , she said to mom after spitting it into the basin : I meant to spew it on your head .
Dad praised Qingqing for being thoughtful : knowing what she should do .
Qingqing played in bed after waking up in the morning .
Dad yelled , but she would n't get up and wanted to play a little longer .
Dad looked at Qingqing and teased Qingqing : how come this kid opens her eyes while sleeping ?
How come this kid sounds like " enen " while snoring ?
Qingqing told dad : I am just teasing you .
After she got up and dressed , she would n't eat the red bean buns or red sticky rice congee prepared by dad .
Instead she asked for soaked biscuits and did drawings in the room after finishing .
After a simple lunch , Qingqing wanted to buy stickers at Jinsheng .
She bumped into grandma on her way and also saw a lost dog advertisement on a wire pole .
Dad read to Qingqing , and then we arrived at Jinrunfa by shuttle bus , but could n't find the stickers that Qingqing wanted .
We then went to Jinsheng , where we finally found them .
Dad bought four volumes : .
One for each of her two sisters .
One to be placed at Qingqing 's home and one at her kindergarten .
Qingqing arranged everything very well .
We got on the bus to dine out .
Mom asked Qingqing to make a choice : is the back of the bus empty or full .
Qingqing first chose " full . "
When it was almost there , Mom asked Qingqing to choose again , and Qingqing chose " empty . "
Qingqing said after getting off : I won .
Mom said : I intentionally let you win , otherwise you will lose .
Qingqing wanted to pee on the way , dad had to hold Qingqing to pee by the tree .
It was very cold , and dad tidied Qingqing 's pants quickly .
Qingqing wanted to play with the sticker after we arrived at the hotel .
Dad discussed conditions with Qingqing : dad will let you play if you eat well .
Qingqing agreed and began to play again .
Mom said she wanted to swap to another place , but dad wanted to let Qingqing stay longer in the sun .
Qingqing was so obsessed with playing that she would n't have dinner .
Dad had to put away Qingqing 's sticker book and asked Qingqing to eat well .
Qingqing said it was spicy and she would n't eat .
Mom promised to buy Qingqing white fungus broth later .
Qingqing became happy immediately and played on .
We walked home after eating , and Qingqing played in her own room after dinner .
Dad said it was time to sleep , but she would n't sleep until after she played for a while in bed .
She told dad that she wanted to take one book to the kindergarten .
Qingqing said today : the teacher said last time that she would repay the money she borrowed from me the next day , but she has not repaid yet .
Oh ! Grown - ups would n't live up to their words either .
Dad promised to remind the teacher for Qingqing .

He is the people 's great savior . "
A melody with infinite passion and vigor exuding from the hearts of hundreds of millions of people bounced and echoed in the sky above the earth , touching even more hearts and souls of those with different skin colors , flowing over countries with different cultures .
Just as MCOA says : whoever is the first to pay attention to Chairman Mao , whoever is the first to learn about Chairman Mao , whoever is the first to profoundly understand the essence of Mao Zedong Thought , whoever is the first to use Mao Zedong Thought and Mao Zedong Spirit to guide one 's actions and work will be the first to enjoy the benefits , the first to become strong , the first to be happy , the first to possess wealth , and the first to gain respect of the people .

ZT Han Han : Car Knowledge and Manifestation of Life -LRB- Regarding the car accident involving that beautiful/talented Taiwanese girl -RRB-

Title : ZT Han Han : Car Knowledge and Manifestation of Life -LRB- Regarding the car accident involving that beautiful/talented Taiwanese girl -RRB-
Poster 's Site : mitbbs.com BBS -LRB- Wed Jan 31 11:16:04 2007 -RRB-
A few days ago , another Taiwanese star passed away .
I had never heard of her .
I hear she was a talented beauty .
What a great pity !
The accident was a car crash .
Much of the entertainment news denounced that +her car 's front airbag failed to release , which caused the death .
In fact , the MINI COOPER she was riding in is not what the reports said .
It is the car with the highest safety index .
It is sold for 190,000 HK dollars in Hong Kong .
Polo also sells for more than 140,000 HK dollars .
It 's just a cute little car , preferred by girls .
But safety is surely not too big of a problem .
The collision happened on the side and rear .
So , the side airbag and air curtain were fully opened .
They opened at the time of first collision with the protective fence .
The first collision was with the protective fence only , and the impact on the people was very small .
In addition , there was the protection of the air curtain .
So , there would surely not be a big problem .
The real fatal collision was the second one from the tailgating truck .
At that time , all the airbags were already deflated .
There was no protective effect .
Furthermore , the force of this one was extremely large .
If the car had been stopped at an angle , then the head of the person sitting on one side would surely have hit the glass or the B column .
Meanwhile , there would not have been too much of a problem for someone on the other side .
This is common knowledge .
Then it came down to who had the bad luck of sitting on the side of the car that was angled out .
It was perfectly correct for the front airbag not to open , because the front of the car was not damaged at all .
None of the sensors received any signal of a collision .
Just imagine , this was a rear collision .
The people went backward abruptly .
Their bodies could have been supported by the seats , but the impact on their necks and heads was tremendous .
When they went abruptly backward , any additional misfortune of the front airbag opening for no reason would have eliminated any chance of survival .
So , of all the cars in the world , even a Rolls - Royce , the front airbag will not open during a rear collision .
If the front airbag opened after being tailgated , that would be a quality problem , and would be extremely dangerous .
The safety airbag 's eruption could knock someone to death .
So , infants are strictly forbidden from sitting in the front seat .
That was how the whole accident took place .
The result of the accident investigation division will not be different from this .
For this kind of accident , conclusions can be drawn from a single glance at the car wreckage .
The car and the car manufacturer have no fault .
All of the car 's passive safety protections had already fully carried out their functions .
So , it is extremely ridiculous and unscientific to blame and suspect the car and the car manufacturer for such an accident .
In particular , speculation about why the front airbags did not open was very amateurish .
Only by not opening would it have been correct .
If they had opened , her assistant might still be lying in the hospital .
If an accident occurs on the freeway , please get out of the car and leave immediately if you can move .
Many freeway accidents occur simply because people stay inside the car and sort out their thoughts , following which there is a fatal crash from a car following behind .
About death , I have always believed that they do not leave the world .
They only leave the human world .
They are surely sharing the same world with us , with a different manifestation of life .

It is in change that we find purpose .

Devastating Critique of the Arab World by One of Its Own
Thanks again to my friend Nick Keck for passing this along via e-mail .
It is the text of a speech given by an Arab gentleman before the advisory board of a large multi-nation corporation .
It 's a long but very worthwhile read .
`` A View from the Eye of the Storm ''
Talk delivered by Haim Harari at a meeting of the International Advisory Board of a large multi-national corporation , April , 2004 :
`` As you know , I usually provide the scientific and technological `` entertainment '' in our meetings , but , on this occasion , our Chairman suggested that I present my own personal view on events in the part of the world from which I come .
I have never been and I will never be a Government official and I have no privileged information .
My perspective is entirely based on what I see , on what I read and on the fact that my family has lived in this region for almost 200 years .
You may regard my views as those of the proverbial taxi driver , which you are supposed to question , when you visit a country .
I could have shared with you some fascinating facts and some personal thoughts about the Israeli - Arab conflict .
However , I will touch upon it only in passing .
I prefer to devote most of my remarks to the broader picture of the region and its place in world events .
I refer to the entire area between Pakistan and Morocco , which is predominantly Arab , predominantly Moslem , but includes many non-Arab and also significant non-Moslem minorities .
Why do I put aside Israel and its own immediate neighborhood ?
Because Israel and any problems related to it , in spite of what you might read or hear in the world media , is not the central issue , and has never been the central issue in the upheaval in the region .
Yes , there is a 100 year - old Israeli - Arab conflict ,
but it is not where the main show is .
The millions who died in the Iran - Iraq war had nothing to do with Israel .
The mass murder happening right now in Sudan , where the Arab Moslem regime is massacring its black Christian citizens , has nothing to do with Israel .
The frequent reports from Algeria about the murders of hundreds of civilians in one village or another by other Algerians have nothing to do with Israel .
Saddam Hussein did not invade Kuwait , endanger Saudi Arabia and butcher his own people because of Israel .
Egypt did not use poison gas against Yemen in the 60's because of Israel .
Assad the Father did not kill tens of thousands of his own citizens in one week in El Hamma in Syria because of Israel .
The Taliban control of Afghanistan and the civil war there had nothing to do with Israel .
The Libyan blowing up of the Pan - Am flight had nothing to do with Israel , and I could go on and on and on .
The root of the trouble is that this entire Moslem region is totally dysfunctional , by any standard of the word , and would have been so even if Israel had joined the Arab league and an independent Palestine had existed for 100 years .
The 22 member countries of the Arab league , from Mauritania to the Gulf States , have a total population of 300 millions , larger than the US and almost as large as the EU before its expansion .
They have a land area larger than either the US or all of Europe .
These 22 countries , with all their oil and natural resources , have a combined GDP smaller than that of Netherlands plus Belgium and equal to half of the GDP of California alone .
Within this meager GDP , the gaps between rich and poor are beyond belief
and too many of the rich made their money not by succeeding in business , but by being corrupt rulers .
The social status of women is far below what it was in the Western World 150 years ago .
Human rights are below any reasonable standard , in spite of the grotesque fact that Libya was elected Chair of the UN Human Rights commission .
According to a report prepared by a committee of Arab intellectuals and published under the auspices of the U.N. , the number of books translated by the entire Arab world is much smaller than what little Greece alone translates .
The total number of scientific publications of 300 million Arabs is less than that of 6 million Israelis .
Birth rates in the region are very high , increasing the poverty , the social gaps and the cultural decline .
And all of this is happening in a region , which only 30 years ago , was believed to be the next wealthy part of the world , and in a Moslem area , which developed , at some point in history , one of the most advanced cultures in the world .
It is fair to say that this creates an unprecedented breeding ground for cruel dictators , terror networks , fanaticism , incitement , suicide murders and general decline .
It is also a fact that almost everybody in the region blames this situation on the United States , on Israel , on Western Civilization , on Judaism and Christianity , on anyone and anything , except themselves .
A word about the millions of decent , honest , good people who are either devout Moslems or are not very religious but grew up in Moslem families :
They are double victims of an outside world , which now develops Islamophobia , and of their own environment which breaks their heart by being totally dysfunctional .
The problem is that the vast silent majority of these Moslems are not part of the terror and the incitement , but they also do not stand up political leaders , intellectuals , business people and many others .
Many of them can certainly tell right from wrong , but are afraid to express their views .
The events of the last few years have amplified four issues , which have always existed , but have never been as rampant as in the present upheaval in the region .
A few more years may pass before everybody acknowledges that it is a World War ,
but we are already well into it .
These are the four main pillars of the current World Conflict , or perhaps we should already refer to it as `` the undeclared World War III '' : against it . They become accomplices , by omission , and this applies to
*1 .
Suicide murders are not a new invention
but they have been made popular , if I may use this expression , only lately .
Even after September 11 , it seems that most of the Western World does not yet understand this weapon .
It is a very potent psychological weapon .
Its real direct impact is relatively minor .
The total number of casualties from hundreds of suicide murders within Israel in the last three years is much smaller than those due to car accidents .
September 11 was quantitatively much less lethal than many earthquakes
More people die from AIDS in one day in Africa than all the Russians who died in the hands of Chechnya - based Moslem suicide murderers since that conflict started .
Saddam killed every month more people than all those who died from suicide murders since the Coalition occupation of Iraq .
So what is all the fuss about suicide killings ?
It creates headlines .
It is spectacular .
It is frightening .
It is a very cruel death with bodies dismembered and horrible severe lifelong injuries to many of the wounded .
It is always shown on television in great detail .
One such murder , with the help of hysterical media coverage , can destroy the tourism industry of a country for quite a while , as it did in Bali and in Turkey .
But the real fear comes from the undisputed fact that no defense and no preventive measures can succeed against a determined suicide murderer .
This has not yet penetrated the thinking of the Western World .
The U.S. and Europe are constantly improving their defense against the last murder , not the next one .
We may arrange for the best airport security in the world .
But if you want to murder by suicide , you do not have to board a plane in order to explode yourself and kill many people .
Who could stop a suicide murder in the midst of the crowded line waiting to be checked by the airport metal detector ?
How about the lines to the check - in counters in a busy travel period ?
Put a metal detector in front of every train station in Spain and the terrorists will get the buses .
Protect the buses and they will explode in movie theaters , concert halls , supermarkets , shopping malls , schools and hospitals .
Put guards in front of every concert hall and there will always be a line of people to be checked by the guards
and this line will be the target , not to speak of killing the guards themselves .
You can somewhat reduce your vulnerability by preventive and defensive measures and by strict border controls but not eliminate it and definitely not win the war in a defensive way .
And it is a war !
What is behind the suicide murders ?
Money is , money and power and cold - blooded murderous incitement , nothing else .
It has nothing to do with true fanatic religious beliefs .
No Moslem preacher has ever blown himself up .
No son of an Arab politician or religious leader has ever blown himself up .
No relative of anyone influential has done it .
Would n't you expect some of the religious leaders to do it themselves , or to talk their sons into doing it , if this is truly a supreme act of religious fervor ?
Are n't they interested in the benefits of going to Heaven ?
Instead , they send outcast women , naive children , retarded people and young incited hotheads .
They promise them the delights , mostly sexual , of the next world , and pay their families handsomely after the supreme act is performed and enough innocent people are dead .
Suicide murders also have nothing to do with poverty and despair .
The poorest region in the world , by far , is Africa .
It never happens there .
There are numerous desperate people in the world , in different cultures , countries and continents .
Desperation does not provide anyone with explosives , reconnaissance and transportation .
There was certainly more despair in Saddam 's Iraq than in Paul Bremmer 's Iraq ,
and no one exploded himself .
A suicide murder is simply a horrible , vicious weapon of cruel , inhuman , cynical , well - funded terrorists , with no regard to human life , including the life of their fellow countrymen , but with very high regard to their own affluent well - being and their hunger for power .
The only way to fight this new `` popular '' weapon is identical to the only way in which you fight organized crime or pirates on the high seas : the offensive way .
Like in the case of organized crime , it is crucial that the forces on the offensive be united and it is crucial to reach the top of the crime pyramid .
You can not eliminate organized crime by arresting the little drug dealer on the street corner .
You must go after the head of the `` Family '' .
If part of the public supports it , others tolerate it , many are afraid of it and some try to explain it away by poverty or by a miserable childhood , organized crime will thrive and so will terrorism .
The United States understands this now , after September 11 .
Russia is beginning to understand it .
Turkey understands it well .
I am very much afraid that most of Europe still does not understand it .
Unfortunately , it seems that Europe will understand it only after suicide murders arrive in Europe in a big way .
In my humble opinion , this will definitely happen .
The Spanish trains and the Istanbul bombings are only the beginning .
The unity of the Civilized World in fighting this horror is absolutely indispensable .
Until Europe wakes up , this unity will not be achieved .
*2 .
Words can be lethal .
They kill people .
It is often said that politicians , diplomats and perhaps also lawyers and business people must sometimes lie , as part of their professional life .
But the norms of politics and diplomacy are childish , in comparison with the level of incitement and total absolute deliberate fabrications , which have reached new heights in the region we are talking about .
An incredible number of people in the Arab world believe that September 11 never happened , or was an American provocation or , even better , a Jewish plot .
You all remember the Iraqi Minister of Information , Mr. Mouhamad Said al-Sahaf and his press conferences when the US forces were already inside Baghdad .
Disinformation at time of war is an accepted tactic .
But to stand , day after day , and to make such preposterous statements , known to everybody to be lies , without even being ridiculed in your own milieu , can only happen in this region .
Mr. Sahaf eventually became a popular icon as a court jester ,
but this did not stop some allegedly respectable newspapers from giving him equal time .
It also does not prevent the Western press from giving credence , every day , even now , to similar liars .
After all , if you want to be an anti-Semite , there are subtle ways of doing it .
You do not have to claim that the holocaust never happened , and that the Jewish temple in Jerusalem never existed .
But millions of Moslems are told by their leaders that this is the case .
When these same leaders make other statements , the Western media report them as if they could be true .
It is a daily occurrence that the same people who finance , arm and dispatch suicide murderers , condemn the act in English in front of western TV cameras , talking to a world audience , which even partly believes them .
It is a daily routine to hear the same leader making opposite statements in Arabic to his people and in English to the rest of the world .
Incitement by Arab TV , accompanied by horror pictures of mutilated bodies , has become a powerful weapon of those who lie , distort and want to destroy everything .
Little children are raised on deep hatred and on admiration of so - called martyrs ,
and the Western World does not notice it because its own TV sets are mostly tuned to soap operas and game shows .
I recommend to you , even though most of you do not understand Arabic , to watch Al Jazeera , from time to time .
You will not believe your own eyes .
But words also work in other ways , more subtle .
A demonstration in Berlin , carrying banners supporting Saddam 's regime and featuring three - year old babies dressed as suicide murderers , is defined by the press and by political leaders as a `` peace demonstration '' .
You may support or oppose the Iraq war , but to refer to fans of Saddam , Arafat or Bin Laden as peace activists is a bit too much .
A woman walks into an Israeli restaurant in mid-day , eats , observes families with old people and children eating their lunch in the adjacent tables and pays the bill .
She then blows herself up , killing 20 people , including many children , with heads and arms rolling around in the restaurant .
She is called `` martyr '' by several Arab leaders and `` activist '' by the European press .
Dignitaries condemn the act but visit her bereaved family and the money flows .
There is a new game in town :
The actual murderer is called `` the military wing '' ,
the one who pays him , equips him and sends him is now called `` the political wing ''
and the head of the operation is called the `` spiritual leader '' .
There are numerous other examples of such Orwellian nomenclature , used every day not only by terror chiefs but also by Western media .
These words are much more dangerous than many people realize .
They provide an emotional infrastructure for atrocities .
It was Joseph Goebbels who said that if you repeat a lie often enough , people will believe it .
He is now being outperformed by his successors .
*3 .
Huge amounts of money , which could have solved many social problems in this dysfunctional part of the world , are channeled into three concentric spheres supporting death and murder .
In the inner circle are the terrorists themselves .
The money funds their travel , explosives , hideouts and permanent search for soft vulnerable targets .
The inner circles are primarily financed by terrorist states like Iran and Syria , until recently also by Iraq and Libya and earlier also by some of the Communist regimes .
These states , as well as the Palestinian Authority , are the safe havens of the wholesale murder vendors .
They are surrounded by a second wider circle of direct supporters , planners , commanders , preachers , all of whom make a living , usually a very comfortable living , by serving as terror infrastructure .
Finally , we find the third circle of so - called religious , educational and welfare organizations , which actually do some good , feed the hungry and provide some schooling , but brainwash a new generation with hatred , lies and ignorance .
This circle operates mostly through mosques , madrasas and other religious establishments but also through inciting electronic and printed media .
It is this circle that makes sure that women remain inferior , that democracy is unthinkable and that exposure to the outside world is minimal .
It is also that circle that leads the way in blaming everybody outside the Moslem world , for the miseries of the region .
The outer circle is largely financed by Saudi Arabia , but also by donations from certain Moslem communities in the United States and Europe and , to a smaller extent , by donations of European Governments to various NGO's and by certain United Nations organizations , whose goals may be noble , but they are infested and exploited by agents of the outer circle .
The Saudi regime , of course , will be the next victim of major terror , when the inner circle will explode into the outer circle .
The Saudis are beginning to understand it , but they fight the inner circles , while still financing the infrastructure at the outer circle .
Figuratively speaking , this outer circle is the guardian , which makes sure that the people look and listen inwards to the inner circle of terror and incitement , rather than to the world outside .
Some parts of this same outer circle actually operate as a result of fear from , or blackmail by , the inner circles .
The horrifying added factor is the high birth rate .
Half of the population of the Arab world is under the age of 20 , the most receptive age to incitement , guaranteeing two more generations of blind hatred .
Some of the leaders of these various circles live very comfortably on their loot .
You meet their children in the best private schools in Europe , not in the training camps of suicide murderers .
The Jihad `` soldiers '' join packaged death tours to Iraq and other hotspots , while some of their leaders ski in Switzerland .
Mrs. Arafat , who lives in Paris with her daughter , receives tens of thousands of dollars per month from the allegedly bankrupt Palestinian Authority , while a typical local ringleader of the Al-Aksa brigade , reporting to Arafat , receives only a cash payment of a couple of hundred dollars , for performing murders at the retail level .
*4 .
The civilized world believes in democracy , the rule of law , including international law , human rights , free speech and free press , among other liberties .
There are naive old - fashioned habits such as respecting religious sites and symbols , not using ambulances and hospitals for acts of war , avoiding the mutilation of dead bodies and not using children as human shields or human bombs .
Never in history , not even in the Nazi period , was there such total disregard of all of the above as we observe now .
Every student of political science debates how you prevent an anti-democratic force from winning a democratic election and abolishing democracy .
Other aspects of a civilized society must also have limitations .
Can a policeman open fire on someone trying to kill him ?
Can a government listen to phone conversations of terrorists and drug dealers ?
Does free speech protect you when you shout `` fire '' in a crowded theater ?
Should there be death penalty , for deliberate multiple murders ?
These are the old - fashioned dilemmas .
But now we have an entire new set .
Do you raid a mosque , which serves as a terrorist ammunition storage ?
Do you return fire , if you are attacked from a hospital ?
Do you storm a church taken over by terrorists who took the priests hostages ?
Do you search every ambulance after a few suicide murderers use ambulances to reach their targets ?
Do you strip every woman because one pretended to be pregnant and carried a suicide bomb on her belly ?
Do you shoot back at someone trying to kill you , standing deliberately behind a group of children ?
Do you raid terrorist headquarters , hidden in a mental hospital ?
Do you shoot an arch-murderer who deliberately moves from one location to another , always surrounded by children ?
All of these happen daily in Iraq and in the Palestinian areas .
What do you do ?
Well , you do not want to face the dilemma .
But it can not be avoided .
Suppose , for the sake of discussion , that someone would openly stay in a well - known address in Teheran , hosted by the Iranian Government and financed by it , executing one atrocity after another in Spain or in France , killing hundreds of innocent people , accepting responsibility for the crimes , promising in public TV interviews to do more of the same , while the Government of Iran issues public condemnations of his acts but continues to host him , invite him to official functions and treat him as a great dignitary .
I leave it to you as homework to figur out what Spain or France would have done , in such a situation .
The problem is that the civilized world is still having illusions about the rule of law in a totally lawless environment .
It is trying to play ice hockey by sending a ballerina ice - skater into the ring or to knock out a heavyweight boxer by a chess player .
In the same way that no country has a law against cannibals eating its prime minister , because such an act is unthinkable , international law does not address killers shooting from hospitals , mosques and ambulances , while being protected by their Government or society .
International law does not know how to handle someone who sends children to throw stones , stands behind them and shoots with immunity and can not be arrested because he is sheltered by a Government .
International law does not know how to deal with a leader of murderers who is royally and comfortably hosted by a country , which pretends to condemn his acts or just claims to be too weak to arrest him .
The amazing thing is that all of these crooks demand protection under international law , and define all those who attack them as `` war criminals , '' with some Western media repeating the allegations .
The good news is that all of this is temporary ,
because the evolution of international law has always adapted itself to reality .
The punishment for suicide murder should be death or arrest before the murder , not during and not after .
After every world war , the rules of international law have changed , and the same will happen after the present one .
But during the twilight zone , a lot of harm can be done .
The picture I described here is not pretty .
What can we do about it ?
In the short run , only fight and win .
In the long run , only educate the next generation and open it to the world .
The inner circles can and must be destroyed by force .
The outer circle can not be eliminated by force .
Here we need financial starvation of the organizing elite , more power to women , more education , counter-propaganda , boycott whenever feasible and access to Western media , internet and the international scene .
Above all , we need a total absolute unity and determination of the civilized world against all three circles of evil .
Allow me , for a moment , to depart from my alleged role as a taxi driver and return to science .
When you have a malignant tumor , you may remove the tumor itself surgically .
You may also starve it by preventing new blood from reaching it from other parts of the body , thereby preventing new `` supplies '' from expanding the tumor .
If you want to be sure , it is best to do both .
But before you fight and win , by force or otherwise , you have to realize that you are in a war , and this may take Europe a few more years .
In order to win , it is necessary to first eliminate the terrorist regimes , so that no Government in the world will serve as a safe haven for these people .
I do not want to comment here on whether the American - led attack on Iraq was justified from the point of view of weapons of mass destruction or any other pre-war argument , but I can look at the post-war map of Western Asia .
Now that Afghanistan , Iraq and Libya are out , two and a half terrorist states remain : Iran , Syria and Lebanon , the latter being a Syrian colony .
Perhaps Sudan should be added to the list .
As a result of the conquest of Afghanistan and Iraq , both Iran and Syria are now totally surrounded by territories unfriendly to them .
Iran is encircled by Afghanistan , by the Gulf States , Iraq and the Moslem republics of the former Soviet Union .
Syria is surrounded by Turkey , Iraq , Jordan and Israel .
This is a significant strategic change and it applies strong pressure on the terrorist countries .
It is not surprising that Iran is so active in trying to incite a Shiite uprising in Iraq .
I do not know if the American plan was actually to encircle both Iran and Syria , but that is the resulting situation .
In my humble opinion , the number one danger to the world today is Iran and its regime .
It definitely has ambitions to rule vast areas and to expand in all directions .
It has an ideology which claims supremacy over Western culture .
It is ruthless .
It has proven that it can execute elaborate terrorist acts without leaving too many traces , using Iranian Embassies .
It is clearly trying to develop nuclear weapons .
Its so - called moderates and conservatives play their own virtuoso version of the `` good - cop versus bad - cop '' game .
Iran sponsors Syrian terrorism ,
it is certainly behind much of the action in Iraq ,
it is fully funding the Hezbollah and , through it , the Palestinian Hamas and Islamic Jihad ;
it performed acts of terror at least in Europe and in South America and probably also in Uzbekistan and Saudi Arabia
and it truly leads a multi-national terror consortium , which includes , as minor players , Syria , Lebanon and certain Shiite elements in Iraq .
Nevertheless , most European countries still trade with Iran , try to appease it and refuse to read the clear signals .
In order to win the war it is also necessary to dry the financial resources of the terror conglomerate .
It is pointless to try to understand the subtle differences between the Sunni terror of Al Qaeda and Hamas and the Shiite terror of Hezbollah , Sadr and other Iranian - inspired enterprises .
When it serves their business needs , all of them collaborate beautifully .
It is crucial to stop Saudi and other financial support of the outer circle , which is the fertile breeding ground of terror .
It is important to monitor all donations from the Western World to Islamic organizations , to monitor the finances of international relief organizations and to react with forceful economic measures to any small sign of financial aid to any of the three circles of terrorism .
It is also important to act decisively against the campaign of lies and fabrications and to monitor those Western media who collaborate with it out of naivety , financial interests or ignorance .
Above all , never surrender to terror .
No one will ever know whether the recent elections in Spain would have yielded a different result , if not for the train bombings a few days earlier .
But it really does not matter .
What matters is that the terrorists believe that they caused the result and that they won by driving Spain out of Iraq .
The Spanish story will surely end up being extremely costly to other European countries , including France , who is now expelling inciting preachers and forbidding veils and including others who sent troops to Iraq .
In the long run , Spain itself will pay even more .
Is the solution a democratic Arab world ?
If by democracy we mean free elections but also free press , free speech , a functioning judicial system , civil liberties , equality to women , free international travel , exposure to international media and ideas , laws against racial incitement and against defamation , and avoidance of lawless behavior regarding hospitals , places of worship and children , then yes , democracy is the solution .
If democracy is just free elections , it is likely that the most fanatic regime will be elected , the one whose incitement and fabrications are the most inflammatory .
We have seen it already in Algeria and , to a certain extent , in Turkey .
It will happen again , if the ground is not prepared very carefully .
On the other hand , a certain transition democracy , as in Jordan , may be a better temporary solution , paving the way for the real thing , perhaps in the same way that an immediate sudden democracy did not work in Russia and would not have worked in China .
I have no doubt that the civilized world will prevail .
But the longer it takes us to understand the new landscape of this war , the more costly and painful the victory will be .
Its understandable recoil from wars , following the horrors of World War II , may cost thousands of additional innocent lives , before the tide will turn .

Only time right now for some quick thoughts on Haditha .
Or rather , Haditha 's elevation as Iraq 's official , bad apple atrocity .
Even for those who try to pay attention to what filters through the fog of war crimes , these things tend to run together .
Haditha is n't Abu Sifa where , according to Iraqi police , US forces '' on a rampage '' executed a family of 11 , then bombed their house , burned their cars and slaughtered their animals .
What more will we hear of Abu Sifa , now Haditha has become the representative and inevitable example of honour 's exception ?
Because along with Haditha comes Jesse Macbeth , allegedly a former Army Ranger and Iraq war veteran , whose claims that massacre was method rather than madness rapidly went viral on the Net .
His story was unsubstantiated and exteme , yet plausible because it was extreme , and provided a template to the pattern of force on exhibit in Iraq .
A pattern rarely admitted by the West 's institutional media .
But Macbeth , it now appears , is the Pentagon 's timely strawman to buttress its case for Haditha 's exceptionalism , and to discredit influential anti-war voices such as Iraq Veterans Against the War .
Whether unaware or not of his status as a COINTELPRO asset , it does n't matter ,
because regardless , Macbeth became a lucky charm for those who refuse to believe the program of horror in which US troops are engaged ,
and there are many .
Similar stories may now be said to have been `` debunked , '' without examination or a straining of battlefield ethics .
It was a scandal 20 years ago when Ronald Reagan - the Bush family 's post-Hinkley Zombie - in - Chief - honoured the SS dead at Bitburg , and by turn paid homage to the old fascist `` anti-communist '' front of the Republican Heritage Groups Council .
It was , perhaps , merely a prefigurement of the Nazi stain in America 's own blood cult , and what should be a crisis of conscience on Memorial Day .
On supposedly progressive forums I 've seen many apologies for Haditha , and for the other Hadithas still cloaked in denial .
Do n't judge the troops too quickly , or too harshly , some write ,
because `` Hell is full of heroes . ''
Heaven , meanwhile , fills with children .
There is no decent place to stand , not in a massacre .
Sorry Jeff
I have posted to you before about this
and I really do not care one iota .
There are too many people in the world ,
resources are limited under current economic models
and this has always gone on .
It 's all about real estate
and this is just foreplay ,
the fucking starts with China ,
deal with it .
As war has become more technologically advanced more civilians have died ,
look at Goya for god 's sake .
It 's not right ,
it 's not wrong ,
it just is ....
Grow up
and quit bitchin ....
Forward over the fallen
and quit moaning over the downsides of Globalisation .
Try reading Philip Caputos ' A Rumour of War .
Anonymous 2:52 , if someone would kill your family - would you also say it 's not right , it 's not wrong , it just is ?
With attitudes like that , there truly is no hope for this planet anymore .
We might as well push the reboot button right now .
`` hell is full of heroes ''
what the fuck does that mean ?
Is this a good thing ?
Is slaughtering people a good thing ?
And what 's anonymous on about ?
`` Grow up
and quit bitchin '' ?
Do we roll over and say this sort of thing is okay just because the ' current economic models ' say so ?
Anonymouth .
A - non - entity .
I think for most Americans the sanctity of the god - fearing soldier going out and making the world right is too near and dear a concept .
`` Support the troops , not the regime ''
That 's a noble idea until you 're supporting the weight of an armoured vehicle on your chest .
The disallusionment of this country is progressing apace
and I sense the growing desperation as people realize that just believing we 're on the right side might not necessarily make it so .
The first `` anonymous '' poster here is certainly a fellow with his own screwed up head stick up his own disgusting ass .
I also think his own understanding of the artistic works he references - Francisco Goya 's Disasters of War and Caputo 's book -- is also supremely naive .
I suggest he take an elementary course in art appreciation at his local university or community college .
`` It 's not right ,
it 's not wrong ,
it just is ... ''
i am so glad some anonymous fuck posted this --
it only proves jeff 's point -LRB- made implicitly and explicitly throughout this entire blog -RRB- that there is a cancer in this country that continues to eat at it : a cancerous heritage linked to nazism and fascism and slavery and holocaust and slaughter ...
anonymousfuck proves it , america !
kudos to him for standing up for the ' convictions ' of his national socialist fathers .

In the fields the bodies burning As the war machine keeps turning
Death and hatred to mankind Poisoning their brainwashed minds
Politicians hide themselves away
They only started the way
Why do n't the go out to fight ?
They leave that up to the poor
Time will tell on their power minds
Making war just for fun
Treating people just like pawns in chess
Wait till their Judgement Day comes
Now in darkness world stops turning
Ashes where the bodies burning
No more War Pigs have the power
Hand of God has struck the hour
Day of Judgement , God is calling
On their knees the War Pigs crawling
Begging mercy for their sins
Satan laughing spreads his wings
Happy Mammonorial Day
The Anonymous at 2:52 PM , albeit lobotomized by the iron triangle 's propaganda , hit upon a major point we should all be aware of .
Iraq , or Iran for that matter , are just foreplay .
The real act occurs when the Empire takes on China .
The only way an industrial power can take on another with ten times its population base is by using what it thinks is its overwhelming advantage .
That would be a massive nuclear strike , incincerating all opposition before it could mobilize , and using its new warfighter technology to mop up everything else .
In the long run , it may be that the Middle Eastern conflagrations are designed to harden the American people to the inevitability of genocide .
Not that it really is inevitable : but it would make ruling a whole lot easier for a government controlled by the military front of the world 's largest private equity firm .
'' .. when the police state crushes HIS family , .. ''
The problem with that catchy idea is that the participants of empire are mostly assured they have a safe haven *when* the bottom falls out or assume they do more so than smuks like me or you .
Let 's face it :
Money buys some security ;
a lot of money buys a lot of security ,
and those that have access to it KNOW what 's going on and have made plans accordingly .
Unfortunately anon 2:52 is n't that far off in Twilight Zone kind of way -
although I do not agree with h / hr ethic morality , there are too many people on earth RIGHT NOW ,
that is , if they ALL WANT to have a car and drive to the mall - and a lot of them are waking up to that idea , which , as it stands now , is impossible .
His nonchelant benign God force mannerism is appalling and is apparent in the Neo-Con World of the Project for a New American Century , which if I 'm not mistaken , did address the issues of exactly what is being said here .
Anotherwords : You are either with us or against us .
Even if you 're with us you might die a horrible death ,
but you still have a chance albeit a minor one .
To paraphrase :
`` They who hold the gold , makes the rules .
Those who hold the gold AND the guns make the reality . ''
From LRC blog :
A Breakdown in Thinking
Posted by Butler Shaffer at 12:53 PM
News reports inform us that American military officials are now convinced that a unit of Marines killed some 24 unarmed Iraqis , including women and six children .
Some of the victims had been shot `` execution style . ''
One government official stated that this atrocity showed `` a total breakdown in morality . ''
What on earth do these officials think all war is , if not a `` breakdown in morality ? ''
If the systematic slaughter of tens or hundreds of thousands of human beings does n't represent a `` breakdown in morality , '' what does ?
Do we have to wait for some major offense , such as illicit sex in the oval office ?
I would go even further than this :
`` war is the mobilization of immorality . ''
Would these apologists for such killings have been satisfied if the same deaths to the same innocents had been brought about by aerial bombs ?
I am reminded of a distinction one of my students tried making a few years ago in contrasting suicide bombers with militarily disciplined killing :
`` at least we have the decency to drop bombs from airplanes , '' he declared .
I wonder what kind of spin the twits at Faux News are putting on this for their audience of the bloodthirsty !
On this Memorial Day weekend , it would be worthwhile for Americans - whose government is running this abattoir - to recognize the immorality of their support for such madness .
Those who wave their flags , or emblazon their cars with `` support the troops '' messages , are as much to blame for this so - called `` breakdown in morality '' as anyone else .
Out of a sense of moral decency , this weekend might be an appropriate occasion to remove such symbols from their cars , homes , and - better yet - their minds !
Question : did U.S. troops in WW2 shoot children while their mothers tried to shield them , screaming for mercy ?
Remember Maggot , the Telly Savalas rapist - character from `` The Dirty Dozen ? ''
Jim Brown machine - gunned him for messing with a German woman in a simple act of field justice .
That sort of moral action seemed fairly unremarkable to people back then .
Fast - forward to today 's GI : innured to violence by a lifetime of ultra-violent `` Kill Bill '' movies , ultra-violent FPS video games , he has become the thing an earlier generation was taught was most detestable : a nazi storm trooper , a self - appointed SS death 's - head executioner .
Bereft of any sense of the sacred , he shoots little girls without compunction .
He is , quite literally , insane , a `` Natural Born Killer . ''
These atavistic carrion - birds surely will come home to roost ,
and one thing seems undeniable :
it 's not going to be pretty when they do .
I do n't just mean the troops returning from Iraq : I mean the whole malevolent Culture of Death .
Go for a drive in any U.S. city
and witness the seething hatred Americans have for each other .
`` Your streets will be smeared with blood , '' as the prophecy has it .
A society built on lies , where respect for human life is absent , where every media outlet mirrors the bloodlust , is a society doomed .
`` And what rough beast , its hour come round at last ? ''
Iraq has been a training ground .
Sane people come home scarred for life from such a place .
The real psychopaths graduate to high paying private security contractor jobs and are destined to become the Praetorian Guard for the New World Order .
On that last video game piece , I just posted a comment , referring to a serial killer toy set .
And an article about it .
the article was written 17 years ago about a kid who was not yet near puberty .
Kind of Bart or Lisa 's age back in the days of the original simpsons .
The kid who bought that toy would be in their mid to late 20s right now , possibly with a tour or two of Iraq under their belts .
It 's not the `` Kill Bills '' or the video games that cause this bullshit , not even serial killer toys .
It 's the lack of true culture and connection to anything that really fucks things up .
It 's not the movies ... or the games .
That is it .
After all , ALL life is sacred .
Or none .
there is no middle ground .

To all of you who have never been in a war ....
there is no morality in war . ''
I heard a WW2 vet say this tonight .
Could n't agree more .
It 's one good reason why wars should be last resorts instead of the cool graphics embellished infotainment spectacles that they are .
It 's also why the ultimate responsibility for this lies at Washington 's doorstep .

Washington sold us a bill of goods

Hell , I bet more Americans do more research to buy a f*cking clothes dryer than they did before they bought this war , hook line & sinker .
Of course , a lot of Americans have flip flopped over to the against column .
I just hope they do n't try to scapegoat these boys for acting badly in reeeeeeeeeeeeeeaaaal goddamn bad situation that WE sent them into .
& I do mean WE .
I thought this was a bad idea from the start ,
but what did I do to stop it ?
Wrote my representatives & garnered a collection of condescending form `` You just do n't understand the situation '' letters in return , signed a couple of petitions marched in a march .......
woo - fucking - woo .
In other words , I did n't do shit .
But then , neither did anyone else .

When Roman soldiers asked John the baptist how should they prepare themselves for this Messiah in the book of Luke , John responded , '' Do not terrify men with a view to extortion , neither accuse anyone falsely ;

For an excellent exposure of Chinese Communism go to www.ninecommentaries.com
The following four paragraphs are taken from this website .
For the Chinese Communists killing is also necessary for practical reasons .
The Communist Party began as a group of thugs and scoundrels who killed to obtain power .
Once this precedent was set , there was no going back .
Constant terror was needed to intimidate people and force them to accept , out of fear , the absolute rule of the Chinese Communist Party .
In a normal society , people show care and love for one another , hold life in awe and veneration and give thanks to God .
In the East , people say , `` Do not impose on others what you would not want do to yourself . ''
In the West , people say , `` Love thy neighbor as thyself . ''
Conversely , the CCP holds that `` The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles . ''
In order to keep alive the `` struggles '' within society , hatred must be generated .
Not only does the CCP take lives , it encourages people to kill each other .
It strives to desensitize people towards others ' suffering by surrounding them with constant killing .
It wants them to become numb from frequent exposure to inhumane brutality , and develop the mentality that `` the best you can hope for is to avoid being persecuted . ''
All these lessons taught by brutal suppression enable the CCP to maintain its rule .
In addition to the destruction of countless lives , the CCP also destroyed the soul of the Chinese people .
A great many people have become conditioned to react to the CCP 's threats by entirely surrendering their reason and their principles .
In a sense , these people 's souls have died - something more frightening than physical death .
Back in 1903 , Yale Divinity School established a number of schools and hospitals throughout China that were collectively known as ' Yale in China . '
One of ' Yale in China 's ' most important students was Mao Zedong .
During World War II , ' Yale in China ' was a primary instrument used by the U.S. Establishment and its Office of Strategic Services -LRB- OSS -RRB- to install the Maoists into power .
' Yale in China ' was run by OSS operative Reuben Holden , the husband of Bush 's cousin , and also a member of the Skull and Bones .
`` Yale in China '' was also closely associated with the New York - based Union Theological Seminary , which has been a center for U.S. subversion of Asia .
`` The Maoists made China into the world 's largest opium producer . ''
According to Kathy Griggs , this revolutionary terrorist group is controlling the Marines and Army .
They all operate together .
They actually promoted communists in the OSS , which was started by William Donovan .
So they promote and use communists , who actually want to get rid of the form of U.S. government as a stepping stone to world domination .
So this group , now , in the Army and Marine Corp. has communists at the very top .
One example of this truth is the goings on at Abu Ghraib U.S. Military Prison , which is located twenty miles west of Baghdad .
A large percent of prisoners there have not commited any criminal acts agaisnt the coalition .
The military has a policy of `` random sweeps '' whenever the base is under attack .
They gather all men in the area between the ages 17 for questioning to Abu Ghraib Prison .
After finding out the men 's innocence they are slated for release .
But because of military bureaucracy this can be as long as one year .
General Kapinski states in the `` Taguba Report '' Section 24 -LRB- U -RRB- that as many as 60 percent of Abu Ghraib prisoners are not guilty of any crimes committed agaisnt the coalition .
The release of these innocent prisoners was denied by General Majowski 2nd in command in Iraq .
On the internet type Iraq : Beyond Abu Ghraib : Detention and torture in Iraq .
This is the Amnesty International Report .
Also the February 2004 International Red Cross Report Section 7 which states that 70 to 90 percent of all prisoners held at Abu Ghraib were innocent .
To announce that there must be no criticism of the president , or that we are to stand by the president right or wrong , is not only unpatriotic , and servile , but is morally treasonable to the American public .
- Theodore Roosevelt -
Perhaps the whole reason Mao did his thing was because he was against what he learnt from `` Yale in China '' .
Perhaps he was trying to destroy the influence of a group he felt were trying to rule the world .
Just a thought .
Probably wrong , but maybe not .
One practical result of Mao was the cultural revolution .
This probably severed the Chinese zeitgeist from its cultural and spiritual base .
Its 's easier to commit atrocities in the name of power in this way IMO , well easier to motivate others to do it for you .
Disconnection from the source .
Yet again .
`` A pattern rarely admitted by the West 's institutional media . ''
Rarely admitted that we follow that pattern too .
Its 's always others elsewhere that do that evil stuff .
There seems to be a trend of this sort .
This guy -LRB- Macbeth , great name -RRB- and 911 show a similar pattern .
There is -LRB- potentially -RRB- an ugly truth , either US military violence against civilians , or US admin complicity or responsibility for violence against its own and foreign civilians -LRB- in the WTC , Pentagon and various aircraft -RRB- .
Extreme sensationalist claims surface that may be true -LRB- No jews died in the WTC -RRB- others events that are confirmed , like the van full of Israelis , are shown to be true and suddenly the claim seems even more plausible .
That claim is then exposed as crap , and particularly offensive crap at that , -LRB- especially if you are related to some of the dead Jewish paople from the WTC -RRB- .
Other amazing , hard to credit claims follow , the planes were holograms , or were n't there or whatever .
And the money trail , or the stupidities , like the finding of a highjacker 's passport in the rubble within 12 hours of the event , or the reports of the Seattle Mayor being warned not to fly to the east coast on 911 , or the Bin ladens ' charter flight out of the US during the `` no fly '' period ; all that disappears under the weight of scorn flung at the claims that are wrong .
Here we will show you the truth , but only in a form you can not possibly believe .
Very clever .
So instead of thousands of US soldiers snapping and killing the odd Iraqi civillian , or five . We have claims that many or all US soldiers are murdering Iraqis by the hundreds .
If that was the case there would be fuck all people left in Iraq .
Obviously crap , spoken by a nutter , anything he says or anything that comes from a similar place belongs in the same file `` batshit crazy rubbish designed to discredit us '' .
Truth is soldiers do horrible things in war .
things they would probably have never thought themselves capable of .
Most western armies probably do try to moderate this , just for PR reasons and political ones .
But I bet such concerns are far from the minds of military leaders who can not be bothered to equip or supply their own troops properly .
If the army is disciplined and honourable it is designed to prevent such excesses , designed to produce fearsome perfect warriors who will kill you in a million different ways , but only if you are evil and fight them .
Pity those armies only exist in niave children 's imaginations , or fantasy novels set in mythical worlds .
All this babbling here will remedy nothing .
Ask God 's forgiveness .
Get out while you can .
Revelation 18 : 18:1 And after these things I saw another angel come down from heaven , having great power ;
and the earth was lightened with his glory .
18:2 And he cried mightily with a strong voice , saying , Babylon the great is fallen , is fallen , and is become the habitation of devils , and the hold of every foul spirit , and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird .
18:3 For all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication ,
and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her ,
and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the abundance of her delicacies .
18:4 And I heard another voice from heaven , saying , Come out of her , my people , that ye be not partakers of her sins , and that ye receive not of her plagues .
18:5 For her sins have reached unto heaven , and God hath remembered her iniquities .
Here we go again ...
Remember : there is no conspiracy .
Let 's go over this article slowly , shall we ?
First of all , every war has its share of atrocities and massacres , on both sides .
To think otherwise is to be totally naive and uninformed .
Wait , that is a good definition of the American public in general --
but that 's another story .
A few examples of this .
The Boer war : first case of concentration camps , run by the British to exterminate rebels fighting against the British Empire .
WWI saw regular massacres of unarmed German soldiers who had surrendered to the allies .
WWII saw the bombing of Dresden , a target with very little military importance , and home to thousands of refugees .
Berlin was sacked and thousands of German women raped by the Red Army in 1945 .
Korea witnessed several civilian massacres .
Vietnam had My Lai , and the Tiger Force .
So , today , there are massacres in Iraq ?
The cynic in me just replies : `` And this is ... news ? '' .
Repeat after me , people :
if dumb - as - bricks Americans did not want their precious military to be sullied by civilian massacres , they should not have given President `` W '' Bush the right to invade .
Except very few American citizens had the courage to stand and protest .
And , you mean , the army is now trying to hide the horrible , horrible fact that dozens , maybe hundreds of civilians were murdered in cold blood by US soldiers ?
And this is a conspiracy ?
Wake up , people !
Ever since war exists -LRB- meaning : the dawn of time -RRB- , civilians have been brutalized , raped , tortured and murdered ,
and the higher - ups have covered this by saying drivel and b*llshit such as : `` We do n't torture people in America . ''
-LRB- actual Presidential quote -RRB- .
Please , people , there is no conspiracy here : just a bunch of morons , realizing they have unleashed horror on innocents and trying to cover their asses .
Why do you think only lowly soldiers and no generals have been convicted ?
Because generals have the power , that 's why !
So , one soldier stood up and talked about some razed shithole in Iraq ?
Maybe he is going overboard and creating a fancy tale of horror ?
So what ?
That 's not a cover - up , that 's just some dumb -- and scarred for life -- white trash making shit up .
Of course , the US military is going to jump at the chance to sweep the real skeletons under the carpet , so to speak .
Business as usual , and war is good business .
Nothing to see here , people , move along .
This is the result of more than 60 years of military conditioning .
In WWII , most of the soldiers refused to shoot at people , and shot either in the air or -- at least -- above the heads of enemy soldiers .
In Iraq , well - conditioned army psychopaths are going to shoot at everything that moves .
You do n't like it ?
Too bad , you voted for the moron .
Twice .
One last time :
repugnant ?
Yes .
Disgusting ?
Yes .
Obvious ?
Yes .
Conspiracy ?
No .
It 's just the normal m.o. of the biggest military machine ever created on Earth .
Yay , USA !
Home of the psychos and Land of the militaro - industrial complex !
All praise God , and pass the ammo , we are going to smoke ourselves some Iraqis !
All in the name of God , and freedom , and democracy , and justice , and a foetus ! -LRB- as Bill Hicks would say -RRB-
40 years from now , more horrors , more massacres are going to be unearthed ...
No conspiracy here , people ,
Probably just in time for the next senseless war .
the dumbs leading the sheeps is more like it .
Some mapmakers draw their conclusions on time and space with civil holidays spread out neatly across the spectrum .
There is no `` now '' in Remembrance Day or Groundhog Day or Memorial Day or any other ICON of DAYS .
Now is not the reason why we have the ICON of DAYS .
Now is silent and the landscaape is mindscape is timescape is sanctified .
Sure you can protest Rembembrance Day .
Just do n't wear a poppy .
Now that 's making a statement .
DA : speaking of `` razed shitholes in Iraq '' is employing the language of dehumanization , yes ?
Is a razed shithole in Iraq terribly different from a razed shithole in , say , Waco , Texas ?
Please do n't forget that the Iraqis never did anything to us 'ns .
We 're the bully in their yard ,
and might makes right in the doublespeak of the fascisti .
`` Profits , not people , '' dude .
In your little history lesson -LRB- why not go back to the Romans who slaughtered everyone in Carthage , or , for that matter , the Israelites in the OT , commanded by Yawheh to slaughter man , women , and child ? -RRB- , you mention the bombing of Dresden .
I 'll toss in Hiroshima and Nagasaki ,
but those pilot - murderers were at one remove from the slaughter they were , uh , enabling :
they did n't have to look at the mother trying to shield her kids before pulling the trigger .
Obviously , the pilots did n't think too much about what was happening on the ground , or they would lose their minds -LRB- their souls had already been burned away , whether they knew it or not -RRB- .
I 'm sure there were GIs shooting innocents in WW2 ,
but that kind of atrocity is not emblamatic of the war , in the way that napalm drops and tiger teams are emblamatic of Vietnam , and Fallujah and Abu Graib and Hadifa will be emblamatic of Iraq .
Denying the effects of violent culture is denying the effects of operant conditioning .
Yes , at the root of our monstrous age is the loss of any sense of the sacred , or , more specifically , the acute sense that humans are created in the image of God and that God is very much real and keeping notes ,
but surely one step towards rediscovering human dignity is acknowledging that culture matters .
No one `` turns off the tv '' before first realizing that tv is unhealthy -LRB- Jerry Mander 's book is brilliant in this regard -RRB- , just as no one will `` avert their eyes from the Imperium '' without realizing that Empire - worship is nothing but Moloch - worship .
Moloch ?
Indeed .
As Mother Teresa put it , `` If we accept that a mother can kill even her own child , how can we tell people not to kill one another ?
Any country that accepts abortion , is not teaching its people to love , but to use any violence to get what it wants . ''
Ouch !
Religiosity !
But most certainly the U.S. is `` using any violence to get what it wants , '' and has been for a long time .
Hey , the undead like Cal Thomas say , `` it 's the cost of freedom . ''
Freedom to do what -- obey ?
I like Edward Abbey 's quote -LRB- and we miss you , Ed -RRB- :
`` freedom begins between your ears . ''
'nuff said .

So , by definition , your precious God is not there with them in Heaven , since he failed to protect them at all costs , or any cost , for that matter .
Is cost even relevant to this God of yours ?
Either way , your God is disqualified by your qualifications for entrance into heaven .
I have a couple of questions .
Is Harry Truman in heaven ?
Was Pat Benatar incorrect when she said `` Hell Is For Children ? ''
HEAR , HEAR .
Start making the connections , people , between http://www.abortionno.org/Resources/pictures_2.html this and http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/41186000/jpg/_41186472_kar-child-ap416.jpg this :
that 's what ' intuition ' is all about ...
Dude .
Pat Benatar ?
Hell is paved with the skulls of crapazoid musicians like her .
Question for you .
Was the OT formulation ' what is hateful to you do not do to others ' a fairly rad concept for humans in 1000 BC ?
Or do you think it normal for that time and place ?
And why did the Israelites embrace and defend their silly silly little Torah for lo those many centuries , beset as they were on all sides by truly blood - thirsty pagans ?
How did they do it ?
Was it the yoghurt ?
Was it dumb luck ?
Why defend as a paramount rule what amounts to rather remarkable Humanism ?
Explain the evolutionary biology behind that one , please , and , since you 've set the terms of the debate , leave God out of it .
Good luck .
As for me , I think if people and their governors were enlightened enough to follow that one tenet of Judaism -LRB- or the Christian or Buddhist formulation -RRB- , we 'd all be a lot better off .
oh stop with blaming God for the shithole humanity has made of this world --
all of you who 'd like to bash God or demons or angels or aliens need to look into the mirror to find out why the ground you walk on is cursed .

I just saw again that quaint little scene in ' Bridge Over the River Kwai ' where Alec Guinness tries to read the Geneva Convention to the fanatic Japanese commander .
The Japanese throws the book down and slaps Alec Guinness in the face .
Imagine a prisoner at Abu Graib or Gitmo trying to read the G.C. to his American interrogator .
Actually , on second thought , do n't try to imagine that .

For the record , how can I blame something if I do n't acknowledge its existence .
I believe there is something more than me , or us , but what that something constitutes is pure conjecture .
The concept of God made in man 's image is a conspiracy , plain and simple .
A time - honored strategy to control the masses .
David Koresh may very well be the next Christ figure several hundred years from now ,
and if we could be there then , we would tell the orthodoxy created around his legend that they are insane fools ......
and we would promptly be burned at the stake .
Now , as for the psalms , and other enlightening anecdotes , I dig them , baby , wholeheartedly , so long as everybody 's embraced it completely .
If they have n't , and only some have , then the some are lambs to the slaughter .

Celebration Shooting Turns Wedding Into a Funeral in Southern Gaza Strip
Asad
1/20/2007
Gaza - UPI
The cheers and hails of happiness at a wedding in Khan Younes in the southern Gaza Strip turned into screams and moans of pain after one of the celebrators lost control of his weapon , from which a number of bullets were released that killed the groom 's brother and hit three other relatives of his , turning the wedding into a funeral in moments .
A medical source at Nasser Hospital in Khan Younes told United Press International that Palestinian citizen Kamal Mohamed Al Bashiti -LRB- 33 years old -RRB- died shortly after he was hit by a gunshot in the chest from an accidental shooting at his brother 's wedding in Khan Younes .
Three other relatives of his were also injured in the accident , including two children .
Gaza Strip residents are suffering from the problem of aggravation from the weapons mess and security chaos resulting from the intense spread of weapons in the hands of security agency individuals and members of factions and families .
This is a common practice that claimed the lives of about 350 people last year , according to Palestinian human rights sources .
Mohamed Al Bashiti , 18 -LRB- years old -RRB- , a relative of the victim , mentioned that while the young men were performing dances and popular dabke dances Thursday evening , and while they were in a state of intense rejoicing for the wedding of our relative , Majed Al Bashiti , one of the armed men lost control of his weapon , which he was trying to use to fire to celebrate and greet the groom .
The bullets went astray and hit a number of participants amid a state of panic and terror .
In moments , the wedding cheers turned into screams and the hitting of cheeks .
The participants of the party moved to Nasser Hospital , which lay hundreds of meters away from the site of the wedding .
The tragic news came after a little while : the death of the groom 's brother , who works in one of the security agencies .
An elderly man said , " I asked them not to shoot and asked them for God 's sake not to do it , but they persisted in it , until what happened happened .
A number of women suffered cases of fainting and shock after the tragic accident . "
Some Palestinians are used to shooting in the air during their celebrations , especially weddings , as an expression of their happiness , in spite of the repeated warnings the Ministry of Interior has launched to chase those who take part in this practice .
But the warnings were limited to announcements after each incident , without translating into actual procedure in reality .
A researcher at the Palestinian Center for Human Rights , Yasser Abd Al Ghafoor , said this is not the first time victims have fallen in similar incidents , noting that the rights organizations observed several incidents in which victims fell and injuries occurred during wedding and celebration gunfire , one of the common misuses of weapons in the Gaza Strip .
The city of Khan Younes had witnessed on the third of last July a similar incident , when the girl , Amani Al Raqab , died by a bullet that hit her by mistake from a revolver her brother was shooting off on his wedding day .

Abu Dilama
Google is broadcasting a new video recording of Saddam 's corpse after his execution .
A new video recording depicting the corpse of the late Iraqi president Saddam Hussein after his execution on the morning of the first day of the Eidul Adha was broadcasted Monday evening on the Google Internet website .
The video shows Saddam Hussein lying covered on a stretcher whilst the camera closes on him .
Then the covering is removed from his face which has traces of blood on it in addition to a deep wound on his neck .
The video also plays voices of those next to the corpse speaking to each other .
One of them says " quickly " apparently asking the person who is filming to do it quickly .
Someone is calling to another man in a loud voice saying .. " Abu Ali , Abu Ali .. you will be responsible " for the matter " before the tone of his voice starts to rise in a way suggesting that he is under pressure because the filming is taking too long .
The clip does not last longer than half a minute and is the second one being broadcast unofficially on the Internet following the film taken on a mobile phone last week which recorded the execution of Saddam and depicted insults and repeated Shiite slogans by those who attended his execution .

Abd al - Bari Atwan : -LRB- President Saddam -RRB- Great in His Life .. Great in His Martyrdom
Asad
1/02/2007
This unprecedented Arab and international interest in the execution of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and the barbaric way in which it was carried out , confirms the importance of the man , his prominent status , and his distinguished role in the history of the Arab region .
The American administration , who planned carefully for this event through experts in media and public relations , and its tools in Iraq and the inclinations of public opinion did not at all expect such an opposite result , which along with the destructive consequences that may result from it in the coming days have caught them by surprise .
Saddam Hussein proceeded to the gallows like a proud mountain , with head raised , standing upright , looking down at the insignificant things and insignificant people , believing in his creed and his Arabism , repeating slogans of pride and dignity , after he confirmed his faith .
He confirmed it by repeating verses from the noble Koran and the two testimonies .
He will be envied by all Arab leaders , both living and dead , for this honorable martyrdom , and this enormous love in the midst of hundreds of millions of Arabs and Muslims all over the different parts of the world .
Saddam Hussein was the only leader in the modern history of this nation who went to the guillotine because he was a patriot who refused occupation and surrender to the invasion , and chose resistance .
The only ones who preceded him in this honor were men like Umar al - Mukhtar and Yusuf al - Azma , by whose struggle the nation and its history were honored , and kept it for them in the records of pride and dignity .
They hastily executed him because they feared him even when he was behind bars , just as they will still fear him as a corpse hidden under the soil of the homeland , and comparisons between his time and their bloody and chaotic time always came in his favor , and the calls for his return to save Iraq from its crisis and the corrupt and malicious gang that governs it have become deafening to the ears of the occupation and its accomplices .
He embarrassed them and dwarfed them by standing as a spear in the prisoner 's dock .
They were terrified by the penetrating looks of his eyes .
They were exposed by his patriotism and Arabism and his contempt for the odious sectarian divisions that they planted in their contaminated new Iraq .
So they decided to get rid of him with a confused and embarrassing hastiness .
Thanks to the technology of the mobile phone which enabled us to recognize the ugly face of the hateful sectarianism that is governing in America 's Iraq .
This tape exposed the government of the Green Zone , and blew up all the plans for censorship and fraud by the experts of the American Intelligence service and their agents .
It presented us with the naked truth , without that being the intention of its owner .
He was right when he turned to them and said , " Are these your men ? " when they were directing insults at him while he was proceeding to the gallows in magnanimity and with self - respect , repeating the noble words , " and when the ignorant address them they say ' peace . ' "
Is it manliness to shout hateful sectarian slogans in front of a man who has never been sectarian , and the rope of the gallows is being wound around his neck , and his soul will go to its Creator in a few seconds ?
Are these the tolerant ethics of Islam ?
Are these the values of Arabism , decency , and pride ?
Are those the sons of the great Iraq which had always stood up against invaders throughout history and was a pillar of support for its nation and the causes of justice in the world as a whole ?
We are sorry , but not surprised , because some Arab governments objected only because the execution took place on the day of the feast of Bairam , as if the execution of this man would have been permissible and blessed on any other day .
We are sorry again because most of the Arab leaders hid in their palaces and none of them dared to speak even one word of protest out of fear of America .
We were stabbed twice , first when we watched an Arab leader being led to the gallows in accordance with sectarian justice which is spiteful and vengeful . And the second time when we did not see anyone among the club of leaders to which he belonged for more than 30 years object to his execution .
Maybe God wanted a good end for him , and a good reputation , when He induced one of them to record what America and the government of sects wanted to hide , by means of the video of the last moments , which created a historic turning point that will perhaps shape the history of the region , and the nature of events in it for decades to come .
Maybe God wanted to expose the series of lies of Muwaffaq al - Rabi the National Security Advisor in the government of occupation . -LRB- Where is that security ? -RRB- , who went out to the world saying that he , meaning President Saddam , was weak and collapsing while he was on his way to meet his God .
Then the tape comes along and shows us with sound and image that we are in front of a courageous lion , who refuses to wear the mask , just as he refused to take the tranquilizing pills they offered him .
Why the mask , and why the pills ?
The mask is for traitors and criminals who are ashamed of their treason or their crimes , and the tranquilizing pills are appropriate for those who can not face history because of their bad deeds .
The American administration committed a fatal mistake and revealed a major foolishness to be added to its many foolishnesses in Iraq when it executed this man , in a way for which it will pay a hefty price in the near future .
His survival would have benefited it much more than his execution if they understood politics as they should , because his survival could have been a card to threaten the sectarians and keep them as servants to them and their schemes , just as it could have been a bargaining chip for calming down the resistance and the broad Iraqi sector which supports it .
But they do not know anything except grudges , and they do not want anything other than inflicting more degradation on the Arabs and Muslims by his execution .
Perhaps the American administration will have succeeded in one thing only , intentionally and with planning or without it , namely , deepening the sectarian breach not only in Iraq but in the Islamic world as a whole .
It was not by coincidence that Nouri al - Maliki signed the decision to carry out the execution .
And it was also not a matter of coincidence that the task of carrying it out was assigned to spiteful sectarians as we have seen in the videotape .
Al - Talabani hid or fled , along with all those who participated in the project of the American occupation and gave it a legitimate cover , from the other sect .
This execution will deal a strong blow to all the efforts of national reconciliation .
It will lead to the escalation of attacks against the American forces and those cooperating with it .
It will pour more oil on the fire of the civil war that has already been kindled .
Those who carried out the death sentence do not want reconciliation or to maintain a unified Iraq .
Rather , they are working to blow it up ; tolerance , forgiveness , and patience are basic characteristics not found in those people .
Saddam had negative traits and positive traits , but he was not killed because of his negative traits , but rather because of his positive traits , which were his belief in Arab unity , resistance to the enemies of the nation , building an unprecedented industrial and educational foundation , and challenging America .
He chose resistance and rejected safe and luxurious exile .
The curse of Saddam will continue to chase them , chase the Americans , and chase his spiteful sectarian executioners .
Just as Al - Qaeda emerged from the womb of Israeli arrogance in Lebanon and American arrogance in Iraq , Saddam 's Al - Qaeda will emerge from the womb of the degrading execution process .
Pendant of Soldier in Golan Since 1967 War Found
The Cold of the North
Gaza - Dunya al - Watan .
Students at schools of the Qisrin settlement found the pendant of a Syrian soldier south of the occupied Syrian Golan .
On the pendant was written the name of the soldier , Mahmoud bin Ali , and his military serial number M 16241 .
He was a Muslim , and his blood type was A+ .
The two students , Alexander Ghuliyandrin and Oleg Darutsigh , said that they were on a trip last Saturday morning when they reached a military fortification near Qisrin .
It was obvious that man 's foot had not stepped on this place for a long time ago .
The two students entered the fortification where they found old medical equipment and a number of military helmets and a canteen , as well as a military pendant covered with mud and very dirty .
The two students took the pendant home with them and cleaned it and washed it .
They were surprised that it did not belong to an Israeli soldier because the writing on it was in Arabic and they did not understand anything that was written on it .
The two students took the pendant with them to school on Sunday and tried to consult the teacher to find out what was written on it .
It turned out that it belonged to a Syrian soldier whose name was Mahmoud bin Ali .
His military serial number was 16241 , and the writing also indicated that he was a Muslim and his blood type was A+ .
A senior officer in the Israeli army who fought in the Golan during the June War as well as in the October War , said that from the descriptions of the place and the fortification given by the two boys , they go back to the war of June 1967 , because the Syrian army did not establish fortifications south of the Golan during the October War .
The officer added that the presence of the pendant in the place together with medicines and medical equipment indicates that the soldier was injured , and it is probable that his fate is still unknown to his family and relatives and no one knows what happened to him .
The strange thing is that the Arab and Syrian media are kept oblivious of these news stories which are concerned with the prisoners and soldiers lost in that war .
Theoretically I 'll be here .
theoretically ?
yeah .
You mean , do n't you well , you carry multiple calendars , so you never know ?
Well I do have two .
One in the office and one at home .
oh
The weekend after that %uh I will not be in town .
But , %um yeah ,
as I say , theoretically I 'm here .
yeah .
I have n't decided whether I 'm doing this yet .
It is a bit silly , you know ?
I was just there .
But I 've been , %um ,
the next weekend again I 'm invited for the
let 's see
the child of my favorite cousin is being baptized ,
and they want me to be the godmother
%mm .
English .
Patentante , ja .
Yes ,
And , so , since I did n't go to their wedding , I -- feeling this big pressure .
I should have just gone to the wedding last year .
It was , like oh yeah . in
They started asking me when I was on vacation already .
And so I 'm sort of
it 's easier to think about doing it when you 're on vacation yeah . than if you get this idea %eh when you 're at work and say , oh I ca n't go in four weeks .
How could I possibly just do that ?
yeah I know the feeling .
I m-
But once you 're in vacation mode , it 's sort of like well why should n't I ?
I have the vacation ,
it 's just you know , the time , and the money ,
and what is money for
yeah .
Right .
So I have to make up
It 's a debate .
You sound like you 're the bank .
No .
But I have to make up my mind here by Friday because that 's when I can hold my ticket too .
So I thought I could get a ticket .
I just have to have a discussion with my boss .
So you have to let me know what this entails as consequences for me ?
oh for ,
oh yes .
oh there are good consequences , if you 're willing .
I mean , aside from
so I have to be there on the twentieth in Berlin ,
okay .
uh-huh .
And I could n't go for you know , just , For the day . you know three days .
So I had to go at least a week .
yeah .
And there was an advantage .
It 's because ,
and if you 'd like to join me I 'd love it ,
I was also invited to a wedding on the twelfth somewhere near Duesseldorf .
Between Duesseldorf and Essen .
Well that can only be Rathingen or
No it 's north of Rathingen ,
because I 've seen a map .
But it 's in a small thing .
oh Ketting ?
k-
Ketwig .
Ketwig , Ketwig .
Yes .
yeah ,
that 's almost Duesseldorf .
%uh , that 's almost Essen .
okay .
Whichever .
I suppose that 's close .
yeah ,
it 's not far .
Through the S - bahn here .
I mean it 's like twenty minutes .
Or something .
And so , if I do it , I 'd love to have you join me .
It 's a fancy wedding too .
Does that mean I have to get
Do I have to wear a tie ?
Yes .
Sure .
y-
%um
could be it 's actually
I ca n't believe this .
This is a German friend that I
he worked here at NASA for like two years and was in mhm our German conversation club .
yeah .
And he 's marrying a German woman .
I mean he just went back a little while ago because his
No he 's an American ,
but he 's marrying a German woman .
oh , he 's a German .
He 's German too .
yeah .
They 're both German .
So this is a real mhm . German wedding .
But
And so he was saying we should come from our
and one other person from our group is going because we would
he had n't gotten around to planning his vacation .
So he 's going to be there .
So I thought well that 's on the twelfth , and the other thing is on the twentieth , you know .
Why not ?
And then in between I 'm going to go down and 586.14_588.20_A: see my relatives in Bonn .
oh well the twentieth i- ,
I mean that could be a pro- , e-
Well no not the twentieth .
The twentieth is my baptism .
%ah so .
The wedding is the twelfth .
The wedding is the twelfth ?
But it 's like a real thing .
There 's like a wedding at eleven , and a lunch at Schloss Ketwig or something at lunchtime .
And then at seven o'clock there is , let 's see , %uh dinner dance . mit Abendgarderobe .
oh God . nay
But I thought you playing piano you must have that .
Abendgarderobe .
Does n't that mean like really fancy clothes ?
%uh , well .
Ja , ja .
Ball dresses and , you know , tuxedos and things .
yeah , I know .
I could n't believe it
because I met ,
when I was there on the other trip , I had n't read the invitation before .
I did n't think I was going .
And so I had met , %uh , his name is Heiko , for one day in Hamburg .
We met .
yeah .
So he mentioned that he was looking for his tuxedo .
And I said you 're going to get married in a tuxedo ?
He said no , no , no .
That evening .
I 've never heard of such a thing .
Quite a wedding .
But so if you want to bow out .
Pardon ?
I said if you really do n't like those things .
Well .
But you know . It 's great meals .
Really .
Free food .
Aside from , we can talk ,
and they should be nice people .
It 'll be
and then I 'll know one more person there .
How old are they ?
oh .
A little bit younger than us .
oh , he 's probably
good question .
I do n't know .
Maybe he 's thirty - two ?
That 's okay .
As long as they 're not twenty - one .
oh no , no , no , no .
No %uh , spring chicken
This is Herr Doktor Heiko Hecht and Jessika whatever her name is .
ooh .
They actually met in the United States . At I think the University &of Virginia , where he got his doctorate ?
Or , maybe it 's not Virginia ,
but it 's somewhere over there .
mhm .
Something I do n't know .
mhm %hm .
yeah ,
so , you know , they 're not really young .
So I s- ,
their friends I presume are in the same age .
I think there 'll be a lot of family friends .
I have a f-
okay .
yeah ,
I 'm sure .
weddings are always family .
and the way he was talking , it sounds like his wife 's family is well - to - do or something .
so
yeah
well if it , ye-
Interesting people .
If they 're having a wedding with Abendgarderobe then it 's going to be pretty
that 's what I thought .
yeah .
That 's what I thought .
Up upscale .
And that .
So think about it .
yeah . I 'll let you think about that ,
and you can write me a note or give me a call .
Because I know some people really hate weddings .
But you 're afraid to say no ,
or you have to think about it .
But it 's the twelfth .
And otherwise , what I 'd like to try to do is stay with you the twelfth and thirteenth . Because it 's weekend .
mhm .
Like we could see each other .
And then I 'll go Monday -- down to Bonn , or wherever those relatives are because I have n't seen my uncle in like three or four years , and he 's just turning eighty and I like them a lot
uh-huh .
In Bad Muenstereifel ?
yeah ,
I 'll
guess it 'll be summer
so he 'll be in Bad Munstereifel .
mhm
They 've actually moved .
They do n't live in Bonn now .
They live in -- %um , Bad Neuena . Which is I guess
Bad Neuena ja .
yeah ,
just a little bit down .
But I think they 'll be in Munstereifel .
And then my cousin , she still does live in Bonn
so I 'll get to see her .
And then I 'll zip off to Berlin Right . mhm mhm go to this wedding and see my favorite cousin .
Do n't tell the other cousins .
uh-huh .
yeah .
Because you see , when I was there before I could n't visit you because I did n't want to spend time visiting these other relatives in Bonn .
you 're so diplomatic about all of that , you know
Well I mean if I was visiting you , it would be very hard not to visit them .
but n-
But the year before I .
I would n't , %uh , tell on you , you know .
I know you would n't tell .
But the year before I did it .
But that 's because of we just stopped on the train and I had , you know , two hours .
And we had our wild lunch .
yeah .
And on again .
yeah .
That 's
We , %uh , commiserated .
Yes .
That sounds like you have you know its positive end result , which is good .
I do n't know .
I mean , it 's a change ,
that 's for sure .
It 's a change .
And it is a lot of work , obviously .
yeah ,
I ,
%eh but you know I really do n't know if it 's a lot of work .
I always have this feeling I 'm just so terribly slow .
I have this feeling I should always be doing these things much faster than I get them done .
Well , so what if you 're slow ?
You know , look at it the other way .
yeah
but I always keep %eh that I 'm spending too much time , that I should be doing other things .
yeah .
I just had this talk about somebody who was you know , confirming , you know
and I know I 'm too self critical .
So . It 's not a good idea .
Because I was complaining to them about my mother
and they are this theory that , you know , what people do is a reflection of you .
%huh .
Because this woman had such a that people react to you as a reflection of you .
And what I had mentioned about my mother bugging me was the fact that every time I see her or we even talk , she has to comment about my clothes , or what I 'm wearing .
and I was talking to this woman because she seemed to have such a good relationship with her mother .
Like her mother treated her like a human being and not a kid .
%hm yeah
and so she said you know and she 's just a reflection .
You know your mother 's being critical you know .
Be you see that because you 're critical to yourself too much
Or you 're filtering the information you get from your mother
yeah
but this is ridiculous .
I mean %uh she 's never let up on that .
I mean it 's crazy . You know .
I do n't I mean
and I think no not the last time the last time on the phone I bugged her about something else that I been trying to not take anymore
but then she cries
but that does n't work with me .
uh-huh .
That 's good .
Then she says I 'm being mean .
and I ignore the fact that she 's crying .
I 'm pretty tough .
yeah
yeah
speaking of crying , I have a colleague . An American girl , a dancer . mhm at a school in Cologne mhm Who somehow or other has fallen in love with me .
mhm
and now that I 'm , going back to Duesseldorf she 's all going crazy . %um and thinks %eh
she 's %eh concluded that I 'm abandoning her .
oho
But it is
Being stalked here ?
Pardon ?
In America , we would say are you being stalked ?
so he said to let your wife do it you know
%uh right
he says %uh you know no I 'm going to
%eh so now I 'm at a point that it 's very strange
like I wo n't complain about anything
or I ca n't complain about anything
and I ca n't ask him to come help me in the middle of the night when I forgot to take out something they put in the freezer
So we 'll see how it goes
hopefully
I mean they promise me you know everybody that they 're going to help me and that whatever I say
But you know everybody gives you %uh these %uh pro-
yeah
so you 've already started
Well I 've started working with Du
like I do n't cook anymore
I have n't worked in the kitchen for a week already
I 've been just doing with him learning how to do the orders and meeting all the %um sales people
and %um I 've learned how to work the computer which is the bigges-
I said I do n't know how to turn it on even
really
So I 'm not
I do n't know if I could do it yet by myself
but he 's showing me teaching me
and I think like the middle of this week he 'll be there a few days with me
and then anoth-
he %um
Maybe here and there
but he 's really basically
What is he going to do
He 's going to be a teacher for %um High school computers
oh okay
yeah
so he 's only teaching three days a week
so he always says that on the other days if I need him he 'll come in
the truth is he 's been teaching and very patient and very good
and he also is great that he has written down everything
I 'm sure he 's thrilled to get out of there
Well I 'll tell you the truth %uh
I mean now that I worked with him one to one He does do everything with his heart
I mean he has a different head than everybody else
like I know that he wants everything to be nice and to be good and
but he 's very separate
and he does n't like to listen to other people 's %um ideas
but %um I 'm sure financially he was probably great for the kibbutz because he was cheap
yeah
because he 's also
I 'll tell you
I worked with him this whole week
he does n't eat a thing ever
like all morning long
so he does n't eat
he does n't drink coffee
I did n't see him drink anything water or anything else
one day he said I better drink something I have a headache because it was really hot
but I mean you know he does n't eat anything
and then for lunch when we finally went to go get something to eat Also he eats like a little What we would eat maybe half for a meal
and that 's it
so I can understand now why he thinks that because he does n't have big eyes you know
right
that 's so funny
but anyway
no
so he had agreed to do it for a year
and his year is over
I
are you excited at all about it
or
well I 'll tell you the truth
until I made the decision I was scared and also utz
I miss the cooking part
You miss it
that 's funny
I
yeah
yeah
like this week even when they made the %um coleslaw you know & kept calling me to taste it and make sure that it was the way that I do it
and so Matty said to me Ellen you did n't make the coleslaw
I said it 's over you know
I ca n't do everything
tha-
and they 're going to notice that the cooking is different
Well that 's what even **ruthie** says you know
everyone thinks that the economie is so important
but there 's a lot of things that are very important of running the kitchen
and we 'll see
%uh right now Ramon %uh
you know Cocoa she got married
She married that guy
not the Israeli guy not the Sephardic guy but No you 're kidding that little feminine kind of guy
No
but reme-
when I was there in October she had that guy from Yerushalaim that guy
yeah
820.26_822.65_B: no
but %um it was over already around then
but they were still friends
and this guy was a here or something drawer
I think his family is Romanian or something
anyway
yeah
it was very fast
and they got married
How old is she ?
She 's eighteen and a half
she 'll be nineteen in December
oh my god
why did they allow that
Well I guess they did n't have a choice
but the worst thing was originally when she came to her parents and she was going to get married she was going to get married in October
but she got engaged like before Pesach
so going to get married in October
so they were n't so thrilled
but at least okay it 's %uh
and then all of a sudden they came back and said no we want to get married
they got married the I think oh my g- second week in June
on kibbutz
yeah
it was beautiful
we do weddings %eh so much nicer than in the old days
first of all we rent tables and chairs
yeah
so it 's like
and we did it on the grass outside the
and it was beautiful
we read
that
so she 's like the first child who got married
right
and we rented beautiful china and silverware and glasses
wow
beautiful
I must admit it was really really beautiful
and then serving everything we use like %um all different kinds of bought kind of %um paper plates that
uh-huh
probably like the hard plastic
and it was amazing because they even had like a bar set up
and they had oh my go- fruit
they had hay
and then they had fruit
it was gorgeous
it was absolutely gorgeous
Does she now have to do tzavah or no
no no
but %ah marriage is
you do n't have to do the tzavah
oh my go-
So she 's working now in the vegetarian kitchen and the a little bit
but she 's going to study in September
so that 's not so long
Does she cover her hair
No
oh I keep
that other guy was real
this one is
I can not bel-
oh this other one 's like from a family that 's not at all
but he
yeah
they went to America for a month after the wedding
her grandparents sent them %uh oh my Even though they were mad
you know the typical Ariella story
they came for Pesach
and then they told them
they waited to tell them that they got engaged
and the wedding is in June
and they were so angry because how the hell could they come back after years
that 's true
No
so on one hand I understand them
it 's not fair
No of course not
965.04_967.89_B: even they could have called them before Pesach
maybe they would 've changed their minds
but
wait
yeah
Natan 's sister was here also
So they were all upset that the grandparents did n't come back for the wedding
but I do n't know
you have to look at you know both
oh my
I ca n't believe she got married
I
she got married
and then the week after Ta'al Paer got married
you know Ta'al is the oldest %uh girl on the
I
yeah
where is she living
Well her husband he looks like Mickey our Mickey yeah when Mickey was really young
so he looks really young
%uh she just finished now the army
and she met him during the army
he 's from a nonreligious kibbutz
oh my gosh
yeah
So now they 're living on his kibbutz %um because they allow like B'nai to live there
but I do n't know they can work outside yeah do whatever they want until they decide what they want or do what they want
do whatever they want
study
I do n't know what they 're doing
his parents are n't even living on the kibbutz anymore because he 's a professor of something or other in I do n't know China or somewhere
Singapore
I do n't know where
anyway so that was really weird
like when she got engaged it was a little hard for Rachel because he 's not religious and everyone was really upset
gosh you would think at least in Israel you would get what you want
No
but not only that
what
this kid just left the kibbutz at eighteen
and now at nineteen he 's coming back with &uh you know like
He also had a lot of different boyfriends during her lifetime
anyway to make a long story short she had her wedding also
but hers we did like %um a buffet
so I was really nervous about that because when did we ever do a buffet
so we rented the tables and chairs again
and we rented all the beautiful dishes
yeah
But we set up the buffet
we bought like these really neat
you know like they 're
Well we saved them because you can wash them
they 're made out of plastic
but they look like silver trays
uh-huh
yeah
So we bought all different shapes and sizes
and we put out the salads and the meats and all different kinds that
we had %um little cocktail hot dogs
and we had chicken legs
and we had schnitzels
oh and they made a beautiful basket with breads you know everything falling out on the table
you know those kind of things
no
wow
No
it was beautiful
it also came out really nice
the only thing
you guys must feel so old that you have married children already
yeah
we do feel old
and it was beautiful
Ramona 's was nicer because they had a great band and everybody was that
you know like usually in a wedding there 's no room to dance
but the whole parking lot was for dancing
and on the grass was where we sat
wow
uh-huh
so it was like as if you would 've seen you know dance festival because there was like a circle of men a circle of girls a circle of her friends a circle of his friends because there was enough room the kids had a circle that you could have like five six different circles all over the place
oh my gosh
it was beautiful
and Ta'al 's
what happened
you know that Rachel was really worried that people wo n't dance for her be happy for her
I do n't know why
that was ridiculous because everyone was just as happy
but her band they got stuck somewhere
and their %um
something with the electric equipment
it did n't come
so we had to get from us the amplifiers
and ours are terrible
%mm oy
they could n't hear anything
so So some people got really you know
just they did n't dance
and she was really upset
I said Rachel why did you even bother paying them
Well that 's true
getting this really great group
and even if we would 've known they were stuck so call the kibbutz
we would 've sent the car to go get it
right
oh gosh
so that was bad news
but other than that
so anybody else engaged
not yet
the rest are young
well that whole class that whole first
no
but there was only those two girls Ta'al from the first class
Ramona from the second
now these other kids just finished high school
like & 's oldest daughter is going to the army next week or two weeks
wow
but does n't she have a son who 's older
yeah
her son is still in the army
uh-huh
no
but he 's not engaged yet
I think boys wait a little longer
mhm
yeah maybe
Is Liat still going with that guy ?
Unbelievable .
yeah
things are g-

uh-huh .
And %uh Westinghouse supposedly is making a bid to buy the %uh C B S broadcasting network .
I thought they bought them already .
Well , you know , it takes months to close a deal
so there 's -- %ah . -- lots of speculation -- Right . -- that they 'll have to sell the %uh electronics division in order to do that .
and what would happen with you ?
I guess we 'd be sold to another company and see what happens .
I do n't know .
mhm .
I 'm not too concerned about it though
but it 's a possibility .
But you have a senior position there .
Well , I suppose so .
But , you know . They do n't really think of it that way
they just look at the numbers how many people they want and how many people they have .
It 's just a business .
Right .
they just get rid of what they do n't want .
uh-huh .
But %uh that 's still going pretty well .
%huh
nothing really new with the house or anything
We 've had some interesting incidents with wasps that have %uh been invading the neighborhood .
they built a nest in my rafters of my house and busted through .
But I told you about that , I think .
I got a in the mail .
yeah .
So that
Well I wanted to ask you what 's with the school ?
The schools are extremely expensive .
I 'm going broke basically doing that .
And I do n't know how to %uh handle that .
But how come they do n't help you ?
It does n't make a difference .
you 're still going to go broke whether they help you or not .
They 're not going to let you run a profit when you 're on scholarship .
if you have two thousand dollars at the end of the year they 're not going to say oh well %uh I guess you can have that .
They 're going to make you pay everything .
Wait a minute
I 'm talking about
wait
wait fir-
I 'm talking about your schooling .
My schooling ?
I thought you meant the kids ' school .
My schooling ?
yeah .
I do n't know .
I put it on hold all the time .
took a course last semester
I have n't signed up yet for the fall
It 's a lot of stress .
It 's a lot of stress .
trying to
you know you put out a lot of money
and you have to work really hard to get it back .
Right .
there 's not necessarily any benefit to it either .
So
%hm .
sorry I was talking about the kids ' school .
Right
the kids . yeah
R J told me how much -- yeah . -- it costs .
But meanwhile -- It 's a lot of money . -- she does n't know how much you pay .
I do n't know why that is .
I think what we pay
%um %mm we have to %uh
%uh for two kids it cost about two hundred dollars apiece .
uh-huh ?
And then for %um the taxes and everything else maybe if it costs %uh a year %um maybe %uh seven hundred dollars a kid .
okay .
That 's total everything .
Pretty much .
yeah .
Pretty much .
So we 're paying about eight times that .
No about five times that .
yeah
five times that
No , actually , %ah we 're paying six times that .
I 'm paying four thousand two hundred dollars a kid . %uh Or more .
Right .
Right .
But then you could also look into the other part . the tax bracket
yeah .
here f- %uh
yeah
forty - five
forty - five , actually with all the other taxes that are going on here
the first job %uh I pay forty - five percent -- mhm . -- my salary .
It goes to taxes .
And then with all of my second job , it already comes out to fifty - five percent of that .
%mm %mm %mm .
Plus the taxes .
Unbelievable .
That 's incredible .
I remember I got the first paycheck
yeah
I pretty much knew that 's what the statistics were .
Right .
As soon as you get the paycheck and you see the before tax income and you say wow finally you 're able to get up to a decent number and then you look at the bottom
and you say what is this .
You put it into your little pocket calculator --
-- you say they 're taking fifty - five percent
says fifty - five percent .
I say what country -- -- in their right mind takes fif-
what about %eh trying to encourage the populace to go to work and to save more , to earn more .
%uh they do n't care .
But you still like it there ?
Fifty - five
But yo-
yeah ,
because you 're able
You 're still
%hm ?
It 's great .
It 's great .
We enjoy it .
The kids are happy .
Having a wonderful time .
yeah .
And %um even with all the political nonsense that goes on here you still feel that we 're %uh %uh building the place in a very small way .
And also the community .
we love it here .
Well I 'm sure you do .
It 's a great community .
yeah .
yeah .
It 's a nice place .
It 's a very nice place .
And I spoke to someone the other day %uh %uh about you .
oh yeah ?
Plenty of jobs .
Are you serious ?
Because you know what the problem is
there 's a guy who 's working with me now who 's an Israeli
and he 's active .
Do n't believe them .
What are they all liars ?
I mean , what 's the story here ?
You 're i-
Yes .
First of all , Israeli who is living in America -- yeah . -- has to justify himself .
So that 's what he 's going to do .
I suppose so
because man he 's just like one thing after the next .
you 're into software , right ?
yeah .
You know that guy Gordon %uh Go-
%uh %uh I do n't want to mention his name .
David Gordon ?
No .
oh
oh I know
the other guy who au-
Right
yeah
the
Ri-
mhm
That he said there 's absolutely no problem .
No problem .
%hm %hm .
He said any kind of job at a very very high salary . %uh with %uh the experience that %uh you have is absolutely no problem .
yeah ,
so what am I waiting for ?
Do you be b-
%huh ?
So what am I waiting for ?
Where does he live ,
in your community ?
yeah .
You still building
there 's no housing available though there ?
%uh , housing is %uh right now %uh %uh %uh rentals .
Only rentals ?
I would n't %uh ren-
%uh you could buy
but I would n't suggest it right now .
But they have rentals ?
yeah .
And what do they rent it at ?
You want to ge- %ah %ah %ah
let 's see
you can get a-
Just a ex-
For %uh a %uh nice apartment you can
house like my size is
the house I have -- mhm . -- would go for about five hundred dollars %uh five fifty a month .
Wow that 's great .
Right .
So you can work down to a small apartment yeah %um which wo- %um probably go for about %uh three %uh hundred and fifty dollars .
and where are most of these jobs located ?
%uh
Some of these Hertzolia
Hertzolia
yeah .
That 's not so bad .
Right
Tel Aviv Hertzolia
Even now they opened up a lot of new roads now they were building since you were here .
uh-huh
But %ah they were building while you were here .
Right .
%um and you can also
Audrey said she got to Tel Aviv the other day in like forty - five minutes
Wow . With the traffic and everything ?
with yeah the traffic
there was no traffic until she got right there to %uh yeah Tel Aviv
%mm %mm %mm
So yeah
it 's a
But you 're talking about jobs in good places , good solid companies developing companies who %um
the thing just for the fun of it then %uh
You know how I feel that
yeah
little Liz has her own reasons for you know being in America .
You should feel comfortable staying there ,
just for the fun %uh %ah send me %uh %ah a resume
okay . I 'll do that .
And I 'll just pass it on just to get an idea of how much you may be able to make .
That sounds okay
yeah .
I think that 's a excellent idea .
%um , I know your wife does n't believe me
but %uh we think about you guys like continuously .
and it really %uh makes my heart ache .
But %uh
yeah
until like you find something that is n't stressful and not boring .
yeah
that 's the main two combinations right ?
yeah .
Not stressful and not boring
yeah .
Well it 's like I have no problems with secretarial work
okay that 's what fitted in to that category because if you are a busy enough secretary you know %eh %mm . you do n't get bored because you are always doing something different
and if your employer is a relatively decent human being you know two if's there
mhm .
but you get no respect
I mean oh you 're a secretary
and the pay is pretty crummy
well it 's pretty much the same as what I 'm getting you know %um depending upon where you work and all
but you know it 's like that 's no answer either
so I 've just been toying with this idea of going back to school and getting a computer science degree so I can always be gainfully employed .
But anyway ,
and you can think about that pregnancy thing
oh yeah
that pregnancy thing
yeah
that
do the
Maybe there 's your hormones calling .
yeah
well no
the funny thing is it 's like ten years ago I would 've said oh yeah that was what I really wanted to be doing is having a baby you know
but like at this point in time it 's kind of like we 're going to do it because if we do n't do it %uh %eh you know in the next year or two we 'd regret it you know
we figure it 's something we 'd want to do
it 's not like we 're doing it because we have to do it or there 's peer pressure
or well a %mm little peer pressure
oh no no no
I know exactly where you 're at because I think about that too
I got about like six or seven years
I figure my body is a very slow %um yeah **maturer**
you know what I mean
like I did n't get my period until I was sixteen
I mean I look like about %uh %uh at least five or six years younger than I actually am
-- and I 'm just starting to get my period actually now -- yeah yeah as an adult .
So I kind of figure well I 'm probably good until at least some time in the early forties
and I could probably go a little longer than that
I know there 's a risk and all that bullshit
yeah .
but %um yeah I think about that too because it 's like I mean I kind of like the way things are going in the total lack of responsibility .
I know
well I mean that 's the thing
kids are cute and all that
and we %mm slept until noon
we got up about ten and was like oh we have to get out of bed played with the cats fell back to sleep
okay I mean we 're talking total slackers
%mm
and I thought gee you know if we had a kid we could n't do this you know
and
%mm
No
you got to be focused on that
and I mean there 's a lots of other things that
I mean as far as like living situation I was feeling kind of settled you know like -- Right . I 'm not going to be like traipsing around
but I mean I could say that for the next five or even eight or maybe -- yeah . -- ten years alright
even if I could project that far which I really ca n't
yeah
but I mean you got a kid you ca n't do fucking ten years w- --
I know .
-- it 's like cool I think I 'll go off to the Orient and start like bouncing from country country .
I know
well and I mean okay Emory wants to get his doctorate
so we 'll know next Spring if he can get at least accepted into the program which hopefully -- %mm . -- you know
and then there 's four or five years doing the damn work
and %mm . He 's crazy
he wants it
that 's fine
he can do it
no problem
but %um that sort of ties us up here although we like the place
we 're in no hurry to leave it
yeah .
and that would be good
But then you know what if he could get a position overseas again which is something both of us have said would be pretty darn good because -- %mm . -- %um you know after coming back from Spain from those two and half years it was n't so much an adjustment to the way things were
it 's just asking the question gee do we really like %um the way things are over here with the lifestyle the nine to five kind of thing
I mean I 'm really in the nine to five thing more so than he is
you know he should be there by oh oh well let 's say eight thirty to nine
but yeah
he does n't care when
well okay
%um and his professor is obviously %uh %uh a great person to work for
so I 'm envious
but %um whatever
you know I 'm caught up %mm . -- in it
and I do n't like it you know
too many days I 'm working and eating at my desk at about twelve o'clock
and I 'm thinking %mm . This is crazy you know
in Spain %uh we had this break
and you sat
you talked to people you know
you enjoyed your food
you relaxed -- %mm . -- you know
and it 's a fairly productive nation right you know
What 's going on here ?
yeah
I mean they both have the advantages and disadvantages
what you have to do is concentrate on the advantages in what ever place you 're in -- mhm -- and think about the disadvantages of the place that you 're not in .
yeah
Otherwise you go nuts right ?
That 's true ,
yeah .
yeah .
I know Laura tried to
%uh because we have email and so she sent me a letter back saying you know remember how crowded the transportation is and %uh what else -- %mm . how expensive everything is
and %uh you know I remember those things of course you know --
And work you know possibilities were a lot more limited
True .
and the language you know yeah . constantly like kind of
like I mean those could be considered positive things as well
yeah
but I mean you mind as well think of them in a negative vie- rather than
mhm sure
They just like worrying over them .
Well you know and that 's why it helps to have kind of a glimpse into the future right ?
And that 's how we got to -- %mm . -- Spain in the first place is we said we wanted to live abroad and we would try to do it you know as teachers
and it turned out that way because -- %mm . -- we had this idea of
and I really feel that that 's important
and so what I 'm having an idea of now is
okay you know Emory works on his doctorate
it takes about five or six years
we have the kid probably
he gets a research position somewhere in France or in Spain %um
and then we move over there
and you know I take care of the kid and do some you know little day labor whatever you know
we 'll see
%mm .
%um and we have relatively mellow life for who knows five or ten years
and then we take it from there .
yeah
because even like you know I mean all that stuff right is all so subject to whatever change in the weather that happens to be right ?
mhm .
oh I know
I know
and it 's like you know what I think because I get the same as you
like some days it 's just kind of like you know what the hell am I doing not with my life but ge-
but I mean just like where do I get the animal just you know to do anything you know
I just lay in bed and dream for the whole day easily
yeah
I know .
Well I know
I know what you 're saying
I feel there 's sort of a line to cross too between really planning it out and worry and stressing over it because for a while a couple months back there I was thinking in terms of oh gosh you know can we ever afford a house
%mm .
and then we sat down and sort of looked at it financially and said is this what we really want to be worrying about right now
and you know I realize no
yeah absolutely .
and so you know you can sort of focus too much on the future
or I know I have this tendency to do that .
And miss the present completely
I mean miss like you know the smell of the goddamn onions frying in the pan yeah . yeah yeah . you know and each little
I mean it 's like as far as I 'm concerned there 's like no pleasure that 's as intense as the one that you are experiencing at that moment you know
you can think about what something might be like or reminisce about the past
but like when you 're there in that moment it 's
I mean everything else just kind of like
it 's almost like time does n't exist . yeah . You know
yeah
Well I know one of the best moments I can recall in these past two months is
okay I get to work a little bit late which is common
and they do n't really care since I 'm an hourly you know
you have to be within a certain time frame
%mm .
and so everyone else is parked .
I 'm way out there in the parking lot closer to where the trees are
and you know I close the door
I just take a deep breath as I go okay another day
and I hear the birds singing --
yeah .
and I just stop for a minute and listen to the birds
and it sort of cheers me up
you know I realize what a minute okay
in that nasty sterile office where the windows do n't even open --
%eh %um I will be for the next eight hours or so
but out here there still is some life going on
and just sort of cheers me up to know that
okay
I can come back to it you know
So that 's
yeah
in that moment I mean nobody is going to like interfere with that at all .
There you are you and the birds you know
yeah
yeah
yup
hey we can find good Spanish wine over here speaking of the moment you know
oh yeah
And every once in a while you know I can remember just being back %um with people or eating some place you know in Barcelona
and %uh so it brings me back
but
I still have n't gone to that fresh French restaurant by your house
%um
I 'm like dying to go there
You mean the one right next to the apartment
yeah yeah yeah
Well it 's not French
it 's just gourmet
it 's gourmet catalon --
oh it 's not
oh I thought it was Fre-
%ah really
yeah yeah
Well even better .
save it for a special occasion you know
and you know you might need a reservation too
yeah %um
yeah
I will
I should have some visitors
and my family 's planning on coming this summer
so I 'll take them there and this fondue place I wanted to take them to also .
yeah yeah
Is the one over in Gracia that
it 's kind of on a corner I think
I think I
%uh
no
there 's a couple places in Gracia that I 've been going to
uh-huh .
But %uh there 's one in the %um Bario Gottigo
actually it 's on the other side of Leotana %huh . Like down over by the Bornillo
okay .
And I 've only eaten there once alright
but I 've been in a million times because every time I pass with somebody I have to show them the place .
uh-huh .
Actually you know I know where I 'm going to go
I have a friend my friend from England
I do n't remember if I told you about her
she 's my old %um roommate mhm . From Oviato
and she 's coming
she got a job down here
she 's coming on Friday to live
mhm
And %ah I
this is like the perfect
because when we lived in Oviato we used to go to this fondue place all the time
that would be the perfect place to take her when she gets her .
yeah
yeah
well I 'm glad to hear that you got a job that you like and %uh %um think that you were able to stay
I was a little bit worried at first you know when you got back there because the money would run out probably in April or so
and you know
yeah
And I mean I knew I would get a job
and after I just stopped thinking about it I just thought well fuck it
I am going
it 's like inevitable
and I want something
I have to get something
and I will
uh-huh
%um %huh
But I just thought that you know I 'll get a job
and at this point if I get desperate I 'll just have to take anything
yeah .
And the fact that I like kind of fell into something that 's Fairly sweet
I mean %eh in the beginning everything kind of starts out nice
but I 'm changing my attitude to the point where I 'm not going to get stressed out about it too much .
I 'm not going to try to change anything
Good
I 'm going to go in there
I 'm going to do a nice job
I 'm going to have a good time uh-huh . you know
and I 'm not going to
I mean it 's not the same
I 'm either
like from working with kids
I mean that was like you know my career for like eight years
mhm .
But this is you know more like
it 's nice
it 's really nice
Well and you can always go back to that if you wanted to you know working at least in the States
or maybe eventually once you have your residency yeah you can work in some place in Spain too with l- %ah
yeah
yeah ,
I do n't have a big draw for it right now
if anything like I 've always wanted to have like a bar or a restaurant
I mean it takes tons of money
yeah
yeah
me too
well
well
But like I 'd love to
That 's why I want to win the lottery first though Or to have enough background money to set that kind of thing up
but %um well
yeah
well %um good
and so you 're probably not going to come back Christmas which is cool
Emory was telling me that
so
yeah
and I probably wo n't
%eh %eh if there 's anything that you think we should be %um working for let us know
oh I do n't know
I do n't know
it 's too difficult
%uh the thing with the Golan to give it back not to give it back I do n't know
everybody has a different opinion
we 've got cousins living there
beautiful beautiful home
and
yeah
yeah
yeah
I do n't know
one half their mind is thinking should they pack the suitcases
and the other half is should we add on another room for the new baby you know
%eh it 's awful
yeah
it 's a crazy crazy
it is
Well what can you do
it 's a terrible thing
I spoke to your mother in May because I wanted to know if you were coming or one of the kids are coming out
No
I did n't yet
I had a summer job
I worked
yeah
well I just finished work yesterday
it was a nine week course
it started in July and ended yesterday
she said
yeah
oh oh nice
Now I have a month 's vacation for Rosh Hashanah and everything
and after Sukkoth we start our new class
so oh very good yeah that 's a good idea My summer vacation starts now
oh that 's good
So yeah
I have about a month off
that 's good
%eh it 's not too late that I called
No no no no not at all %eh
oh good
Good
there 's something else I was in the middle
and I meant to do it weeks a-
I 'm sending a big information and letter to Simon Perez yeah because I heard him say on the radio weeks ago yeah that I mea-
I do n't know if I should really say this
you know it 's really nothing
but
oh well were being
no no
Well maybe it 's politics
maybe we should n't talk politics
%uh it 's environmental politics
it 's not %uh politics though
%um he said that Is- Israel is such a highly I knew that I do n't know I %uh advanced technical country that if there 's something good they 're going to use it
and he mentioned the hormones for the milk yeah oh yeah that was a big thing he- no there was a big thing here about the milk that they put silicon in the milk here or something there was a big thing where they were
it 's hormones to make the cows give more
oh oh oh no
that 's something different
yes
and it 's terrible
it 's a terrible horrible thing
yeah
yeah
when he says we 'll use it you know my heart went down to the floor because we 're fighting here oh I did n't hear that very much against it because it 's such a bad thing
against
yeah
yeah
I did n't hear that
It makes the cows sick
you get all the bacteria
you get the sickness
and
oh jeez I did n't know
I did n't even know that here
and now I 'm not going to drink the milk over here
No no no
I do n't know if they 're using it yet
I do n't know if they are
but it would n't be bad tha-
they 're called growth hormone
yeah
yeah
I know
I 've heard
I think they do that to the chickens
I hear they do the chickens
they want the
yeah
oh they do it here you know
it 's ap-
I 'm getting into a subject which I really did n't intend
but in Canada they wo n't do it
no no
Well a lot of people do n't eat meat anymore because of you know all these objections and all
they 've stopped %uh
it 's true
it 's true
it
Israelis do n't eat that much meat anyway
it 's more we eat fruit vegetables an- yeah yeah stuff
nobody really eats steaks anymore
like I grew up on steaks all the time from Sam 's Supermarket you know all the
yeah
from Sam 's Supermark-
uh-huh
yeah
jeez %uh the last time he had a steak was I do n't know months ago
we do n't even eat steaks anymore
but duh %eh in America too they do n't eat as much do they
%uh no
because for heart the fat is supposed by very bad
yes
Hello
oh yeah
yeah
you said people are not
no
the red meat is suffering I guess
I noticed that last time I was home
but I do n't eat any either
so
yeah
I know it 's not a good idea
I
but Canada does n't use that junk
I mean and they tell us I think Europe wo n't buy from us because they do n't want the hormones with stuff in it
yeah
yeah
I know
I know
it 's %uh
but we 're using it naturally
Well
so everything you kn-
I tell you it breaks my heart when I see them following that
they think everything is so wonderful
if there 's some
yeah
yeah
I know
they take the good and the bad all the
and that 's t-
yeah
oh it 's pitiful
that makes me very very sad
you know oh it 's %eh
very sad
and even the Russians they come over
and I know I can see the attitude %ah well that of course they know for ins-
he 's working in a neighborhood association like on funds
yeah
yeah
on grants
he does a wonderful job
and they help him
oh I think he was n't working when Holly was here
I think he was n't working
he was n't working over yeah oh that 's good that he three and half years
but this is parttime
but it 's very involving
it 's very exciting
oh that 's nice
and I thought that the people line up to see him
and it 's about getting help with housing and food stamps and everything
yeah
and a lady said you know my husband died and old lady
I said oh I 'm sorry
she says I really thought United States that you do n't die you know
and I knew that underlying it they really believe that because if it 's so wonderful
yeah
they know everyone dies
but underneath they feel maybe you do n't die until you 're very very old
but they do n't believe that so many people die in the United States because it 's so wonderful
oh wow I do n't know where they got that idea from
yeah
but you see how it is
jeez
so everybody has these wrong conceptions
I know
I know %eh
%eh %uh it 's %uh pitiful
but
oh well
yeah
I 'm su-
Holly is %uh busy with all her No that 's good now that 's nice cook things
and she 's going to teach
yeah
she had a good time sure
she 'll come back and visit and all
she had a good
oh she 's lost too
oh she misses right now %eh %eh for Rosh Hashanah
yes
she says oh on the kibbutz everybody would go out and have the meal under the stars together the first night
yeah
they have th-
yeah
that 's right
that 's right
and you know it 's just
so she misses
well you know %uh you know it 's like New Year 's %uh
everything is closed and all in America
you do n't feel the holidays because everybody 's busy doing
and here
yes
it 's not Israel although in
Well you live in a very Jewish sec-
I 'm wi-
yeah
here you do
you see him
yeah
So it 's different
but in Hudson oh we used to have to miss school
that 's right
and the teachers used to give us tests on those days just to be mean
and we used to miss the tests and everything
and
I know
Passover time we used to be embarrassed bringing matzos to school and everything
and here I mean You know they do n't know any of those feelings at all you know
I know
I know
I know
it 's th-
it 's very different
so
I know
is it something you know you remember Fred Allen and Irene ?
no I do n't
%uh they 're just names to me really
I 'm sorry
but they 're just names to me
I do n't know them
yeah
oh because you were %ah you know
yeah
they had a farm when they were first married which was like nineteen forty eight
yeah ?
and then they moved away
hello
%uh oh
yeah
I 'm here
yeah
So I think I still got five or ten minutes here as far as I know
I 'm looking at my
Are you timed
or
yeah
yeah
yeah
Well keep talking until we hang up
it 's nice talking to you
yeah
yeah
%um
So what about the Allens ?
then they moved away to Middletown
he was in the girls '
do you remember the girls ' reformatory in Hudson
yeah
yeah
%um
It was right across the street from my Aunt Seal 's house
oh she lived there ?
On Worth Avenue I th-
She did on Wor-
yeah like Bessie lived on Worth Avenue
